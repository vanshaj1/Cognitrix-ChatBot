PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,1kNYgsH40Q0,the overall design flow chip design so today we intend to cover chip design flow am i right and different abstractions linked to it so how many of us remember uh what kind of stages are there in our design flow first stage was design analysis um characterization okay good i'm happy you remember quite a bit so yes the the first stage in fact was for is design analysis where there are different so we will go into each of these stages one by one and look at what each step entails okay and uh don't hesitate to stop me ask questions or add anything if you feel like okay so the first stage is design analysis where the first step is requirement analysis so what do you understand by requirement analysis what do you think is requirement analysis so customer requirement i think specifically solutions that we want in the circuit the basically demand of the market what exactly is required in the market yeah so over here what we are looking at is what is it that the uh customer would pay for is would be willing to pay for for the price point where we want to target our product so if if i want to come up with the next generation of iphone 12 or you know iphone for example now iphone 13 what would the customer be willing to pay the premium for next year so that would become my requirement and then we do the next step which is called the function functional and test specifications what would come into this according to you to test the functionality of our design in the base of requirements so what we just required a buyer design what kind of functions we require yes what kind of functionality is required for example you may say that you know when apple came up with this infrared face recognition feature at that time what functionality is required you need to understand that okay it has to be infrared and it should it should recognize the face and it should unlock the screen if the face recognition is say above or the face matches above say 80 it should also unlock the screen or ninety percent it should only also unlock the scheme and very importantly when you define the functional specifications you also define how will you test that your device is meeting those specifications in various conditions so as soon as you define the functionality how to test it is also defined simultaneously this is something which is not commonly understood and done are we able to appreciate the significance of this aspect so i'm not able to understand how this text specification can be introduced here i mean okay so uh let us take this same feature the face recognition feature that you're talking about so how would you test this camera now if i want to say that apple would have this camera in it how would you test it so most probably i would be taking some samples of pictures or photos and then seeing the quality or the how what the output is then analyzing that output so i may say that i will take 10 000 photos of one person okay and when any of those 10 000 photos is put in front of this camera system it should be able to recognize it as the right person and should unlock the screen that could be one way to test it okay okay so like uh we are specifying the specification from an overview overall from the functional perspective this is the okay i wanted how do i test that this functionality is being met okay okay i know because finally what whether some other functionality happens or not happens doesn't matter functionality that i am selling to my customers should definitely work fine and i should know how to test it this i should know early on when even when i am defining the specification okay answer the functionality you are talking about it is in terms of specification like uh it needs to have a 40 megapixel camera or should be able to detect that that in terms of yes so it is specifications of functional specifications and test specifications functional specifications would say it should be infrared it should be able to identify the person even in an ambient light of let us say a dark room and it should be able to you know differentiate between two brothers for example who look very much alive but are not twins okay so like what the kind of thing we see in the ads of basically that is yeah that is one aspect of it so i gave you an apple example under the face recognition example because that you already see in the ads and it is easy to relate to them yes but for any chip even if you're if you have to design an spga okay for even for an fpga the user would have the specification that its ddr should operate at uh two gigahertz that it should be able to support this kind of throughput it should be able to give this kind of uh uh you know dry stone mix per second whatever okay okay so that also comes here interesting okay okay i gave you a user i took the example of an apple face recognition thing i was i gave test specifications for that but when i talk of functional specs which which does not really materialize into the user or a consumer application then i will anyway have technical functional specifications there okay okay so here also the engineer will be working generating them would be working to define the specifications yes okay so we will define the specification and consultation with the customer who is going to use the product and also the test specifications in consultation with the customer department you had raised your hand uh strict to define the verification of the testing method in the beginning what if the specification changes in at a later stage then it won't be a tedious task to review everything you tell me one thing if the specification changes you anyways need to need to you know come back to the initial phase so let us say you were in this stage at this point of time the customer said no no i do not want this camera to work in infrared light i now want this camera to work at uh regular light with regular light i want a laser to be generated there so do you realize that everything would change for you also the kind of energy that your image sensors will now capture will be very different from what they would capture in an infrared light scenario yes yes so you will anyway need to come back to this stage again because the functional specifications have changed yes okay i was just concerned about the timing part yeah basically if the functional specifications are changing everything would need to be redefined okay and as as soon as you change the functional specification test specification should also be reviewed all over so my and my actually the point was that maybe we can if we are a bit mature state then we can define how to test because then we will be sure that this is like the final product text required no change can be done beyond that as a designer you may want that but as a customer would you want that suppose let us put it like this you want to go and order a double bed for your room and you want it to be succeed by six feet now would you would you give the specification to the to the carpenter right away or say that okay i wanted to be six feet by six feet but i will tell you how i will measure six feet uh after you have you know um cut the plywood no yeah i think goddamn will tell you which scale you're going to use right away so that he also uses the same scale is it not right so the test specifications have to be built alongside functional specifications there is no other way okay and this is what many times i see designers miss out on they think only in terms of functional specification they forget that test specification is equally important to be defined right there correct correct got it thank you sir to be actually making a hardware and then testing it or something else you tell me this is a this is a chip design fluna entire entire thing is a chip design flow is it not listen so in this flow we will actually you actually get silicon in your cell phones is it not like the wafer fabrication and all things are later on so are we actually making it in the initial stages and then testing it we are making the specifications specifications for example example in this what did we say we said that i will tell the carpenter i want a bed a double bed which is six feet by six feet and that i will measure six feet by using this particular scale i have not built the bed yet i have not even purchased the plywood yet but i know what i want in my bedroom that's where so test the testing means is it a simulation or something related to this no testing so for a carpenter thing you will want to actually measure physically the the dimensions of your bed now but the physical thing that you're getting is working exactly the way it was intended to be right yes so you will actually have to characterize and test the silicon wafers that are out or whatever system it is sir uh yes sir so you mean to say that we are just giving the specifications but not actually testing them like functional and test specifications we are just mentioning them what do we test yeah product design has not even started yet what do we test we are simply telling this is how we will test okay okay okay so basically this all the documentation partner uh yes this is in a way the specification the statement of work creation part this is still just documentation no design implementation yet yes okay in fact just after this step if you look the step is called partition and plan what do you think this means uh dividing the follow strategy uh divine implementation dividing the whole strategy of how to implement all the things related with it yeah so some for example if you go back to the actual space recognition example in that particular example it will mean which team will do what kind of work who will design that laser the infrared laser who will design the uh the hardware the chip who will write the software which does the recognition or which does the analysis okay who will integrate all of it and the plan as to by when will different milestones of different such partitions be completed so that i finally have my apple phone uh available in the market by thanksgiving so that people can purchase it for christmas yes sir so that is partitioning and planning all of this the design has not even started okay okay any questions still here yes sir if you talk about in memory sir when we say uh for a room that when when we say that we want to make the connections that we want to i mean diffuse the transistor in in the highest layers so basically that is i mean in that context we say that if the customer uh says that now in the data state of the making the memory at that point of time if the customer says i want this this code to be embedded and not the one that i uh gave i mean i have given to you so is that also not the functional specification that is being changed and then we are not really going to the design analysis uh once again we are just changing the connections so it depends currently like uh depends how big a change the user is asking for and and what is the stage of the design if the change is really that doesn't require any change in the design implementation you will not go back to the scratch board you know the the drawing board all over again but if the specification change is very significant then you will need to do that and you should be aware of this that you cannot really change specification after the implementation has begun or has kind of closed whatever because that means a huge turnaround time it can mean a huge turnaround time yes so usually a good amount of time is spent on this stage the design analysis stage because if this is not done correctly all the effort that goes subsequently so this effort 10 people will do but the design implementation effort for example if it's about a intel microprocessor the typical effort that goes into a microprocessor is 200 million years 300 million years so so many people working across multiple teams across the various sites uh are involved in making a full intel microprocessor and if the first phase design analysis phase is not good enough is is is kind of carelessly done then all those 2 200 manual efforts can simply go down the drain you will come up with the product which will not sell in the market so this is one of the most important parts so in this part what kind of things you get to do in india so since there are very few end-to-end product manufacturers in the country not much of this job gets done in india but in every company whether it is ti or st or samsung or micron uh all these three kinds of jobs exist they typically exist in the headquarters samsung has this kind of jobs in korea st has these kinds of jobs in italy and france ti has them in the u.s micron has them in the us so these kind of this kind of design analysis or product definition thing is is primarily in the headquarters or then somewhere very close to the customer wherever they are getting their maximum sales from they would have some some such jobs in that place also okay once the product specification animation wanted to add something audible yes you're audible so yes sir i wanted to ask if these test specifications right if you would like to test it on uh for example what we were talking about an apple air uh phase recognition system if we would like to test first that application on an fpga which is reconfigurable before making try trying to release this specifications we would want to test it on our fpga right before starting the chip um we don't know so we will come where the fpga and such kind of work would come in we can we can i will i will share about where we can do that emulation part okay so so abhini a when when the customer is defining the specification he has no clue how you would implement it he is simply telling you that i want this okay only when you enter into the design implementation phase you will look at how to validate and verify it okay fpga is largely about verifying your design is it not yes seriously you need to have a design first so a design entry has to happen before that okay yes so in the design implementation stage,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kNYgsH40Q0,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kNYgsH40Q0

design implementation phase you will look at how to validate and verify it okay fpga is largely about verifying your design is it not yes seriously you need to have a design first so a design entry has to happen before that okay yes so in the design implementation stage"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,OLJIYZylox0,we first do the design entry now i know that my my team is to develop that face recognition hardware okay the the the sensors will give me some data and i have to now uh design the hardware which would do the calculations to ensure that face recognition happens accurately so i do the design entry i make it an rtl or something like that after the design entry i synthesize it i say that okay i wanted i wanted a adder there i wanted a multiplier here i wanted a comparator here and so on and i synthesize it i make those connections and then i simulate it saying thereby that the adder and the multiplier and the connectivity of them is working fine it is at this stage you know when you are simulating and if the simulations come fine it is at this stage that you may also want to emulate that is where the fpga or other emulation systems would come in okay and then you enter into the stage of physical design and layout this is hardcore implementation and once that implementation is done you will simply do a design verification that whatever chip i had i have now designed i have now implemented that is in line with the design specifications that i had okay and then what we then what we would do is if we call it as a tape out but then we tape out our chip and send the design to the foundry in the foundry uh yes uh so the design verification step you have uh put it at the very end but design verification as i can remember it comes after synthesis also and like after this yeah everybody at various stages so what kind of design verification are you like me uh focusing on here and this step because yeah so design verification that i have put on this slide over here at the bottom of the design implementation stage is exhaustive it includes simulation based verification includes stages like drc lvs erc techs everything package verification everything is done in this stage only after everything is fine you send something for mass making okay answer like uh we are also including the formal verification and those kind of things we will look at that in the next slide because that is too much detail so okay so over here i've just put the entire design implementation phase into five stages so on the next slide we will look at all those uh detailed you know that these five stages are actually a mix of 20 other activities and each though each of those 20 activities is a different job profile we will look at that in the next slide yes sir rajneesh you had a question yes sir uh sir uh in this uh design implementation sir this uh uh like logic partitioning and planning is present in this physical design also this yeah yeah the floor plan floor plan placement everything we will talk about in the next slide don't worry we will go into much more detail in the next slide so these two are different now this uh design analysis partitioning and planning yes they are very different partitioning that i talked about in design analysis was which team where we'll do which kind of uh designing okay that was the overall partitioning of the project okay uh sir yeah so i don't understand what's the difference between synthesis and physical design we will see and the next slide we will see i mean um i realize this might be a little different but from uh what we studied about fpga like you when you when you're doing synthesis you're doing a mapping and routing i mean i mean all that placement and all that isn't that a part of your layout itself so we will see that in the next slide here just wait a little sure okay so keep this question alive in yourself we will see that in the next slide let me just give you a complete top level overview first then we'll go into the detail okay so once once we are sure that the chip that we have designed you know the layout that we have designed everything is really good good to go we send it to the foundry the foundry first sends it to the mask shop where masks are made and once the masks are available you start to do the wafer fabrication now depending on a technology there could be 39 masks there could be 28 masks there could be 47 masks or there would be 60 masks that that design or a wafer would need to go through to make the entire design so it would depend on technology and the choices that you've made regarding the design okay and the more the number of masks the more the time it takes in the fabrication facility because it is more number of times it has to sit into machines and run through it and also higher the risk of loss because every mass step every step additional step in the foundry means some some heal loss at every step so every extra step means some extra heavy loss that can happen yes vaishnav sir what is this mask exactly sir i mean that yeah we will come to that so mask is like something that we will use to fabricate a design okay okay sir so when we will look at the fabrication process uh in probably the next class or hopefully today i don't know you will get a view of what a mask is okay so yeah once the wafers are fabricated they are sent for testing and characterization so the first test that happens is wafer prototype test what does it mean it means that at the wafer level itself without even cutting the wafer into dice and cutting it into chips so you know how a wafer looks a silicon wafer is a for example a 300 millimeter wafer means that there is this circular silicon wafer a thin thin piece of silicon which is 300 millimeters wide so 12 inches wide the diameter is 12 inches and on this wafer there would be and on this wafer there would be these uh i think that ppt have you just say that the diameter is 12 inches yeah the base foot is 12 inches isn't that quite big i mean yes it is big on one vapor you can have thousands of dice that can be fabricated and sir what exactly a dive die is the chip that will go into your phone okay but yeah you you manufacture all of them together so many of them together so that the overall cost can be low okay so uh so basically we are we are manufacturing many diets in the same paper and then those guys can be later separated yes to decrease the manufacturing costs so we are manufacturing them in bulk yes so the first test you do is on wafer level itself that okay let me see how many dies in this particular wafer are working after that wafer prototype test you identify the good ones and only those good dies you package you don't package the bad ones after packaging you do another testing so so i mean we are testing the good ones twice effectively yes so hoga so every as i said every step that you take there could be some failures happening there so on the wafer you saw that okay out of the thousand dies 990 dies are working so you say okay i will package these 990 dice dives after packaging out of those 990 99 980 may be working so only those 980 you will then send to the customer so but why will something like that happen i mean are we using different tests in uh i mean both the levels i mean prototypes and then package okay and let us put it like this uh have you done some painting any point of time in your life yeah so the first step you do is sketch it with pencil then you start to put some colors into it yes so you suppose you have to put you have to make a rainbow so you have to put seven colors next to each other now i want uh i want only that particular painting to be shipped in which there is no overlap of any color yeah so what can happen after the first step that is the i made it with the pencil okay pencil method overlapped for possibility so it is fine there is no heat loss after the red color again there is no heat loss but as soon as i put the orange color i might end up overlapping it with red somewhere okay okay so that yeah yeah yeah so every extra step that you do there can be somebody lost yes sir so when you package what are you doing you are connecting wires from the pins of the package to the pads on your die there could be some error in that connection therefore he lost okay so you have to test after every step yeah yes we're gonna depend on that [Music] [Music] because we have to describe some pattern only so wait we'll come to mask a little later as i already mentioned we'll look at what a mask is a little later don't worry vapor prototype test is it we are just cutting each and every die and testing it separately whether uh some guys are whether the guys are working or not or is it like uh we are just testing a bit a part of some uh that before is it like in a wafer prototype test you just keep the entire wafer there you bring probes and you put put them on every die one by one okay okay and you test it now suppose you see that there is this entire row which is not working you will not cut the dies of that row into independent pieces you will just discard the entire row when you are cutting the wafer okay so yes so what do you mean by the so what do you mean by the term characterization is this characterization essentially means what is the character of this [Laughter] so characterization essentially means that okay i wanted to design a processor which would work at 1.2 gigahertz okay but i designed it for 1.2 gigahertz but due to some reasons it could work only at 1.1 gigahertz on silicon can it happen okay so i need to know i need to know at what speed it is working so that is why it is called characterization so it is the characteristic of that dye that this dye is working at 1.1 gigahertz and not 1.2 gigahertz okay so like i started with a certain kind of a goal in mind but if it is like differentiating from that i need to know that okay how much it even if it has met the goal even if it has met the objective i need to know that this is 1.2 gigahertz or 1.21 gigahertz okay okay so like finally it is completed now what is like it yeah is it finally it is completed now what is it okay look at it like this so uh childbirth huh so you do an ultra sound you do everything everything you know that the child is developing so i don't know if you have children yet but some point of time you will have probably so you know ultrasound and all those tests you see that the child is growing well but finally when the child characterization happens okay okay okay fine so that is what it is okay what is this uh you know what is how what is this dive finally it is working fine but what is it finally is it operating at 1.2 gigahertz 1.24 gigahertz or 1.16 gigahertz it is working fine what what at what frequency similarly at what power consumption at what leakage at what battery life all those things everything is characterizing that particular dye okay okay so thank you sir okay shivam you had a question yes sir sir actually i want to ask that uh whether the number of transistors that are to be manufactured on this dice is uh decided by our requirement or specifications or is there any rule that a fixed number of transistors or will be manufactured on the particular tie you tell me what should it be sir it should be according to our requirement yes enough so it can happen for example someone may say that i need 1 billion transistors to be put now the technology team may come back and say see if you put 1 billion transistors your die will become this big and the yield will be less instead we recommend that you put 500 million on this chip and add another die which is another 500 million and together you will be able to come up with a much much cheaper and more efficient product that may happen but you would want to put number of devices based on what your requirements are yes okay so there could be a technology constraint you can accommodate that that's a different thing yes yes myself so when we are saying uh that we want our goal is 1.2 gigahertz and somehow we got 1.1 gigahertz now why the customer would accept our chip now so you tell me you tell me do you purchase an intel i3 professor or not at all okay i will select cheaper yeah yeah so but uh if we want 1.2 gigahertz so we should aim a bit higher like 1.25 or 1.3 then we'll get whatever it can be done i will finally what i need to do is i need to characterize and tell this is one point one gigahertz i will select hundred dollars cheaper oh that i still need to do okay for negotiation and something that is working at 1.4 gigahertz i will tell the user oh this is very low power and i will sell it as i7 yes okay you see so i still need to know this information how i achieve what i achieve that is a different thing that is strategy designer strategy we are presently talking about what does the flow entail the fluent is identifying and sorting them so wafer test and die sort package tests and slots see these packages are operating at this frequency these packet is at this frequency and therefore i will sell them separately yes sir okay and then i finally ship it to the customer finally okay so uh after the wafer prototype test so here we have uh tested the functionality whether our die is working properly or not or for every row or column whatever we prototype test and then to paper test or would it be like uh before prototyping this and that paper test and iso so see wafer is when all the dyes are together yes packages after you have separated these dyes and packaged them into their ics so after the package test wafer test can't happen yes sir so in the last step shift production units when i say wafer test and die sort that step is not coming after packaging that that step is coming after wafer prototype test okay because at times what happens is for example that apple face recognition thing you said that laser someone would make image sensors someone would make and the computational processor someone else would make something estimate something samsung made something sony made so now you cannot package just the sensor and say okay this is the chip apple had a product in mind where all these three dies would be put together so you are sending only the wafers and dice to the customer you're not sending packages to the customer yes so at times you send wafers and dice to the customer at times you send packages whatever it is you do the testing and only after that testing you send them yes sir yes sir in the wafer prototype test we put the probe uh on the each die still when still it is part of paper we tested whether it is functionally working or not and then in the wafer test what kind of test you're doing and that what is the difference between these kind of tests right so wafer prototype test and wafer test could be similar but it the last stage involves dye sorting okay okay so like we have characterized before now we are like putting them different categories yes uh so can you elaborate on dice sorting again yeah it is that okay this guy is working at 1.2 gigahertz this diet 1.4 gigahertz i had 1.1 so sorting them into different bins and saying this one sell at 100 100 cheaper this one sent 200 costier this one sell at the target price right so i mean um all the dyes in the wafer do not need to be of the same type may not be yeah may not be okay so sir i mean do these duty steps happen in parallel design characterization and shift production units um it depends they could they may not okay depends on product uh yeah because the thing is you know you can do die sort right after the package prototype test so like no no wait wait wait wait if you already packaged it then you can't then there is no longer die sort then there is packet shot okay like packet sort involves uh what exactly same thing it is that you're shipping packages instead of dice okay so i mean then what's uh so like okay you're performing wait for prototype test and you're performing wafer tests and diastole instead of instead of that you can just do wait for prototype test and follow that up with dye soft so you can do that okay so like that additional wafer test is just like optional again it depends you know it's the wafer prototype test because of uh the so you know it depends on the fab conditions suppose you say that wafer prototype test was done at the at tsmc and wafer test and dyesort [Music] qualcomm would do at its own facility so testing has to happen twice then right right so it depends if it's happening in the same place or different if it is intel it will only happen once oh sir sorry sir my question is what so there can be variation in the thing which we are shipping we can ship the package or we can ship the wafer or we can ship the driver because as you said that at and play and different company different type of tests can happen so that means there can be different type of product which is being shipped is that correct assumption yes yes yes yes there are for example the rfid tags that you keep in your shirts those are small small chips which are which are which are sent only as dyes which are shipped only as dyes on strips of paper okay so uh all kinds of forms and features appear in these chipping parts so i see the hands of vaisnava and gadandeep also raised hello sir uh i want to ask that uh we are doing die sorting and then we are going to i mean do the package sort also so i mean it looks like that we are uh doing a die sword which might not really affect what we said because at the end if i sort the packages then i i need to uh ship those only after categorizing so yeah but if i'm shifting dice but then if i'm shipping dies only then i don't need to package them now yes in that case it would be yeah so not something that has already been packaged will not be wafer tested and die sorted it will only be packaged tested and sorted something which is being shipped as a wafer will be wafer tested and die sorted so it is about what i am going to shape yeah hello okay hello yes yes yes sir actually you were saying that uh like i3 or i7 for example if you take an intel so aren't we doing something i'm like uh we would know that uh before uh uh i mean like we are supposed to make an icon processor but we got an i3 processor uh while doing uh wafer testing it's is it something mean like something has happened and due to some malfunction we have got got an i3 processor or something like that yeah it could be that no so i i gave the names of i3 i7 and i5 but let us say that have you seen that there are products which are exactly the same specification but the frequency is lower only frequency is lower see there is a difference between ic i5 and i7 the difference is not just about speed that difference is also about hardware okay so that could be because some hardware on i5 failed and now you call it i3 okay so uh my doubt was that uh actually uh so have we done some something unintentionally or something so that uh by mistake we have got an ison processor or uh during the function no no no it was designed to be built as an i7 only therefore we designed an i7 but when i7 could not when there were some dice which would not really give that kind of functionality and we felt the customer will not purchase them at that price point we said okay we will sell them a little cheaper okay sir thank you okay so uh let's not enter into i3 i5 i7 let me say that i7 here let us say it is only i7 but there are three different frequencies of i7 itself and each of those i7s is still at a slightly different uh sale point okay sir okay thank you okay yes action sir i have a question like and last generation of intel processors something like happened in laptop that i five is performing right uh better than i seven so what kind of sorting uh yeah so that is where machine learning comes into vlsi okay so they defined some tests and they said that okay if if these parameters on the particular die are positive we will call it i5 if these additional five parameters are positive we will call it i7 okay this was based on their understanding of the design that this when these five additional parameters are also positive that is when the performance will be better so so it was not an hardware issue it was their understanding of how to sort okay uh one way so this is a bit confusing they've got i don't know what exactly happened but uh given from what he just said they confused between i5 and i7 because there was a mix-up with the specifications yes because they felt that this would be faster and it was not actually faster so so i mean uh isn't that like the job of you know your design implementation and then your design characterization i mean um if you're designing it such that okay it should be faster you know that you're designing an i7 right so if it's showing that particular speed then how can you sort it differently see i see it is not just about speed mirror like it is not just about clock frequency at which you are operating uh benchmarks actually test how well you are able to use the the access to the memory for example okay benchmarks would also relate to how easily you are able to transition from one thread to another benchmarks test a lot of things and real life use cases are also like that you're not you know just looking at clock frequency and saying my system is faster finally you go with your experience you know an apple chip you know an apple iphone chip would typically if you look at it operate at a lower frequency but has a much more fluid user experience than an intel chip based design so would you say that the fault was in the test specifications that okay it did not test all the cases it could be anywhere it could be an in their understanding it could be in the design implementation they had designed uh designed it such that that the memory would they have put in more memory and they said this will actually lead to better performance but due to more memory what happened was the wire lengths increased let us say and delay is increased so or or there was a bottleneck in terms of bandwidth due to which the information transfer that you anticipated did not really happen at the same rate right the fault could be anywhere i'm just saying that if they say that okay this was expected to be faster and it is slower it could be simply a die sort algorithm failure also okay it could simply be that but it could be anywhere else previous in the chain also uh right right okay okay so how do we yeah how do we resolve this kind of issue like um so you go back you go back review your design you debug where where did the assumptions go wrong and then you correct those assumptions redo the so you cannot really undo what has already been shipped to the customer yeah yeah but the next chip design that you're doing you have more mature assumptions now and you will therefore design it better so but the problem was with the fact that i mean one of the problems one of the possible problems that okay you couldn't identify one type from another because yeah so you were showing what you expected yeah so you will then upgrade yeah so then you will upgrade your sorting algorithms okay so the next lot that you will sort you will have a better algorithm so therefore the problem will disappear after some time okay should retrain your algorithms then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJIYZylox0,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJIYZylox0
Transcript: we first do the design entry now i know that my my team is to develop that face recognition hardware okay the the the sensors will give me some data and i have to now uh design the hardware which would do the calculations to ensure that face recognition happens accurately so i do the design entry i make it an rtl or something like that after the design entry i synthesize it i say that okay i wanted i wanted a adder there i wanted a multiplier here i wanted a comparator here and so on and i synthesize it i make those connections and then i simulate it saying thereby that the adder and the multiplier and the connectivity of them is working fine it is at this stage you know when you are simulating and if the simulations come fine it is at this stage that you may also want to emulate that is where the fpga or other emulation systems would come in okay and then you enter into the stage of physical design and layout this is hardcore implementation and once that implementation is done you will simply do a design verification that whatever chip i had i have now designed i have now implemented that is in line with the design specifications that i had okay and then what we then what we would do is if we call it as a tape out but then we tape out our chip and send the design to the foundry in the foundry uh yes uh so the design verification step you have uh put it at the very end but design verification as i can remember it comes after synthesis also and like after this yeah everybody at various stages so what kind of design verification are you like me uh focusing on here and this step because yeah so design verification that i have put on this slide over here at the bottom of the design implementation stage is exhaustive it includes simulation based verification includes stages like drc lvs erc techs everything package verification everything is done in this stage only after everything is fine you send something for mass making okay answer like uh we are also including the formal verification and those kind of things we will look at that in the next slide because that is too much detail so okay so over here i've just put the entire design implementation phase into five stages so on the next slide we will look at all those uh detailed you know that these five stages are actually a mix of 20 other activities and each though each of those 20 activities is a different job profile we will look at that in the next slide yes sir rajneesh you had a question yes sir uh sir uh in this uh design implementation sir this uh uh like logic partitioning and planning is present in this physical design also this yeah yeah the floor plan floor plan placement everything we will talk about in the next slide don't worry we will go into much more detail in the next slide so these two are different now this uh design analysis partitioning and planning yes they are very different partitioning that i talked about in design analysis was which team where we'll do which kind of uh designing okay that was the overall partitioning of the project okay uh sir yeah so i don't understand what's the difference between synthesis and physical design we will see and the next slide we will see i mean um i realize this might be a little different but from uh what we studied about fpga like you when you when you're doing synthesis you're doing a mapping and routing i mean i mean all that placement and all that isn't that a part of your layout itself so we will see that in the next slide here just wait a little sure okay so keep this question alive in yourself we will see that in the next slide let me just give you a complete top level overview first then we'll go into the detail okay so once once we are sure that the chip that we have designed you know the layout that we have designed everything is really good good to go we send it to the foundry the foundry first sends it to the mask shop where masks are made and once the masks are available you start to do the wafer fabrication now depending on a technology there could be 39 masks there could be 28 masks there could be 47 masks or there would be 60 masks that that design or a wafer would need to go through to make the entire design so it would depend on technology and the choices that you've made regarding the design okay and the more the number of masks the more the time it takes in the fabrication facility because it is more number of times it has to sit into machines and run through it and also higher the risk of loss because every mass step every step additional step in the foundry means some some heal loss at every step so every extra step means some extra heavy loss that can happen yes vaishnav sir what is this mask exactly sir i mean that yeah we will come to that so mask is like something that we will use to fabricate a design okay okay sir so when we will look at the fabrication process uh in probably the next class or hopefully today i don't know you will get a view of what a mask is okay so yeah once the wafers are fabricated they are sent for testing and characterization so the first test that happens is wafer prototype test what does it mean it means that at the wafer level itself without even cutting the wafer into dice and cutting it into chips so you know how a wafer looks a silicon wafer is a for example a 300 millimeter wafer means that there is this circular silicon wafer a thin thin piece of silicon which is 300 millimeters wide so 12 inches wide the diameter is 12 inches and on this wafer there would be and on this wafer there would be these uh i think that ppt have you just say that the diameter is 12 inches yeah the base foot is 12 inches isn't that quite big i mean yes it is big on one vapor you can have thousands of dice that can be fabricated and sir what exactly a dive die is the chip that will go into your phone okay but yeah you you manufacture all of them together so many of them together so that the overall cost can be low okay so uh so basically we are we are manufacturing many diets in the same paper and then those guys can be later separated yes to decrease the manufacturing costs so we are manufacturing them in bulk yes so the first test you do is on wafer level itself that okay let me see how many dies in this particular wafer are working after that wafer prototype test you identify the good ones and only those good dies you package you don't package the bad ones after packaging you do another testing so so i mean we are testing the good ones twice effectively yes so hoga so every as i said every step that you take there could be some failures happening there so on the wafer you saw that okay out of the thousand dies 990 dies are working so you say okay i will package these 990 dice dives after packaging out of those 990 99 980 may be working so only those 980 you will then send to the customer so but why will something like that happen i mean are we using different tests in uh i mean both the levels i mean prototypes and then package okay and let us put it like this uh have you done some painting any point of time in your life yeah so the first step you do is sketch it with pencil then you start to put some colors into it yes so you suppose you have to put you have to make a rainbow so you have to put seven colors next to each other now i want uh i want only that particular painting to be shipped in which there is no overlap of any color yeah so what can happen after the first step that is the i made it with the pencil okay pencil method overlapped for possibility so it is fine there is no heat loss after the red color again there is no heat loss but as soon as i put the orange color i might end up overlapping it with red somewhere okay okay so that yeah yeah yeah so every extra step that you do there can be somebody lost yes sir so when you package what are you doing you are connecting wires from the pins of the package to the pads on your die there could be some error in that connection therefore he lost okay so you have to test after every step yeah yes we're gonna depend on that [Music] [Music] because we have to describe some pattern only so wait we'll come to mask a little later as i already mentioned we'll look at what a mask is a little later don't worry vapor prototype test is it we are just cutting each and every die and testing it separately whether uh some guys are whether the guys are working or not or is it like uh we are just testing a bit a part of some uh that before is it like in a wafer prototype test you just keep the entire wafer there you bring probes and you put put them on every die one by one okay okay and you test it now suppose you see that there is this entire row which is not working you will not cut the dies of that row into independent pieces you will just discard the entire row when you are cutting the wafer okay so yes so what do you mean by the so what do you mean by the term characterization is this characterization essentially means what is the character of this [Laughter] so characterization essentially means that okay i wanted to design a processor which would work at 1.2 gigahertz okay but i designed it for 1.2 gigahertz but due to some reasons it could work only at 1.1 gigahertz on silicon can it happen okay so i need to know i need to know at what speed it is working so that is why it is called characterization so it is the characteristic of that dye that this dye is working at 1.1 gigahertz and not 1.2 gigahertz okay so like i started with a certain kind of a goal in mind but if it is like differentiating from that i need to know that okay how much it even if it has met the goal even if it has met the objective i need to know that this is 1.2 gigahertz or 1.21 gigahertz okay okay so like finally it is completed now what is like it yeah is it finally it is completed now what is it okay look at it like this so uh childbirth huh so you do an ultra sound you do everything everything you know that the child is developing so i don't know if you have children yet but some point of time you will have probably so you know ultrasound and all those tests you see that the child is growing well but finally when the child characterization happens okay okay okay fine so that is what it is okay what is this uh you know what is how what is this dive finally it is working fine but what is it finally is it operating at 1.2 gigahertz 1.24 gigahertz or 1.16 gigahertz it is working fine what what at what frequency similarly at what power consumption at what leakage at what battery life all those things everything is characterizing that particular dye okay okay so thank you sir okay shivam you had a question yes sir sir actually i want to ask that uh whether the number of transistors that are to be manufactured on this dice is uh decided by our requirement or specifications or is there any rule that a fixed number of transistors or will be manufactured on the particular tie you tell me what should it be sir it should be according to our requirement yes enough so it can happen for example someone may say that i need 1 billion transistors to be put now the technology team may come back and say see if you put 1 billion transistors your die will become this big and the yield will be less instead we recommend that you put 500

put number of devices based on what your requirements are yes okay so there could be a technology constraint you can accommodate that that's a different thing yes yes myself so when we are saying uh that we want our goal is 1.2 gigahertz and somehow we got 1.1 gigahertz now why the customer would accept our chip now so you tell me you tell me do you purchase an intel i3 professor or not at all okay i will select cheaper yeah yeah so but uh if we want 1.2 gigahertz so we should aim a bit higher like 1.25 or 1.3 then we'll get whatever it can be done i will finally what i need to do is i need to characterize and tell this is one point one gigahertz i will select hundred dollars cheaper oh that i still need to do okay for negotiation and something that is working at 1.4 gigahertz i will tell the user oh this is very low power and i will sell it as i7 yes okay you see so i still need to know this information how i achieve what i achieve that is a different thing that is strategy designer strategy we are presently talking about what does the flow entail the fluent is identifying and sorting them so wafer test and die sort package tests and slots see these packages are operating at this frequency these packet is at this frequency and therefore i will sell them separately yes sir okay and then i finally ship it to the customer finally okay so uh after the wafer prototype test so here we have uh tested the functionality whether our die is working properly or not or for every row or column whatever we prototype test and then to paper test or would it be like uh before prototyping this and that paper test and iso so see wafer is when all the dyes are together yes packages after you have separated these dyes and packaged them into their ics so after the package test wafer test can't happen yes sir so in the last step shift production units when i say wafer test and die sort that step is not coming after packaging that that step is coming after wafer

still at a slightly different uh sale point okay sir okay thank you okay yes action sir i have a question like and last generation of intel processors something like happened in laptop that i five is performing right uh better than i seven so what kind of sorting uh yeah so that is where machine learning comes into vlsi okay so they defined some tests and they said that okay if if these parameters

and it is slower it could be simply a die sort algorithm failure also okay it could simply be that but it could be anywhere else previous in the chain also uh right right okay okay so how do we yeah how do we resolve this kind of issue like um so you go back you go back review your design you debug where where did the assumptions go wrong and then you correct those assumptions redo the so you cannot really undo what has already been shipped to the customer yeah yeah but the next chip design that you're doing you have more mature assumptions now and you will therefore design it better so but the problem was with the fact that i mean one of the problems one of the possible problems that okay you couldn't identify one type from another because yeah so you were showing what you expected yeah so you will then upgrade yeah so then you will upgrade your sorting algorithms okay so the next lot that you will sort you will have a better algorithm so therefore the problem will disappear after some time okay should retrain your algorithms then"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,S7091-SZPFk,give me a second i will pause the recording and i will come back again just give me a minute so once we have this you know good overview of how a chip starts from a requirement analysis to finally shipping we enter into this detail of how does the design implementation happen okay so the first stage of the design implementation is initial design entry where you say that okay i need this kind of memory i need this kind of a processor i need this kind of interfaces ddrs and so on and then you do a design entry this design entry is an rtl okay you write a verilog code and that is rtl once you've done the design entry you need to verify that this design is meeting the functionality that you wanted it to meet so do you simulate the rtl and do a quick power analysis that the power budget is also within the you know specified range after that is done you do the logic synthesis now what what do you understand about logic synthesis there was already a question earlier about logic synthesis and layout so what do you understand by logic synthesis it is mapping our uh rtl code to the gate gate level net list [Music] so it is converting an rtl verilog netlist into a gate level net list that okay you just said an adder but an adder is implemented by using these kind of ands and rs and xor gates okay so that implementation is synthesis after the logic synthesis is done you do test and clock synthesis what do you think test and clock synthesis entails uh sir so like uh when we test our code like when we're stimulating so you know you're using a clock signal that you have provided but to actually generate a clock which will run in that system you need to do a block system as well right okay i mean it should uh run at 2.5 megahertz so yeah so let us look at it like this in the logic synthesis you said you will put 1 million flip flops on your chip and for every flip flop you simply put the clock pin am i right in reality clock will be generated by some pll somewhere or you will get it from outside your chip so there is one point on the chip there you will have the clock generated and do you think that one point can drive all the one million flip flops no so we have dog buffers right i mean so you have to now arrange and organize these flip flops in a particular way that okay these ten flip flops this buffer would drive these ten flip flops another buffer would drive so this part of inserting clock buffers so that none of the clock pins or none of the clock signals nodes has a load more than let us say 100 front of arrows additionally you know all the matched clock nodes uh clock ends arrive at almost the same delay so if if there is one flip flop and another flip flop which was supposed to work simultaneously it should not happen that because i put 10 buffers in one path and five in the other path one swap operated much faster than much earlier than the other one so if they were expected to operate synchronously and simultaneously i have to put 10 buffers on both the paths so this is clock synthesis similarly as we talked about you know initial functional specification and testification we look at test synthesis that as to how will i make those scan chains how will i test the entire chip once it is fabricated so at this early stage itself when when you just add the logic synthesis stage or just right after that you start to also do the test synthesis you start to insert some test features also rather you have a question yes sir sir in this clock synthesis are you referring to the clock tree synthesis yes and so one more thing so like after the design entry you have mentioned the power analysis so but design entry is in the rtl form so we still don't have a kind of uh the components that will be involved so what kind of power analysis that they're doing here like how would we know that what kind of power can be considered let us say i i said that i will use a memory somewhere okay and i have not gated the access to the memory so memory every clock cycle memory is being accessed i know that a memory will consume more power i have models for memory also so in that case then what we see is in that case what we see is that your system will show that the power consumption is high that you need to do power gating at some places to reduce overall power consumption so you can change your rtl so that clock dating happens and memory is not accessed every cycle it is only fs when needed so but my question is like rtl at the rt level we still have we are having only a behavior model so like yeah but you okay so it is not just behavioral model so the models that you have you know the very long models that you have many times they are also associated with uh some top-level information on power consumption and timings okay okay like apart from the net list also yes okay so okay um so so it's a about you know designing a chair so uh it could be an asic it could be a assp it could be anything it could be a standard product all together a commodity product not even an asic and not even an assp it is a standard chip anything so you know the difference between asics and asses and standard yes yes i mean i i don't know what you're referring to by standard chips like for example uh atmel uh atmel 32 processor is a standard chip it is available off the shelf anyone can come to the market and purchase it stm32 is a standard chip anyone can come it is not defined or prepared for a particular application whereas for example corus is a product from st which is a specific chip for automotive industry but it is again standard it was not made specifically for bosch it was not made specifically for rolls-royce it was just made so that any user any um car manufacturer can use it okay so you're saying that uh it's like programmable it can be programmed as to the needs of the customer what about programming no no it is not just about programming it is about application for example stm32 is a standard product it could be used across any application whether you use it in a car you can use stm32 whether you use it in your alexa you can use an stm32 whether it is google home you can use stm32 any application can use stm32 even your smartwatch can use stm32 okay so any range of applications it could be automotive it could even be a satellite it could be using stm32 so it is off the shelf available standard product however when i'm talking about let us say an automotive specific product then that product is designed for a particular use inside cars only for example tire tire pressure monitoring sensor yes now tpms you will not use in your watch will you no it will only be used in automotive sector but it is not designed specifically for bosch it is a standard product so it is application specific standard product assp so but like the features are somewhat to save right i mean okay you can you can only do these amount of things in this ship i mean and those those amount of operations can be used in a car or in a watch or anywhere but it's still fixed you cannot you cannot change it you cannot like uh it's not steel programmable like fpga yeah for example uh so that is that there are multiple flavors of let us say stm32 some flavors would have one kilobyte of non-volatile memory some flavors would have 32 kilobytes some would have one megabit okay so that will limit what all you can store and what all so that would change stuff but otherwise it is stm32 to the standard product okay right okay but assp is application specific standard product now tire pressure monitoring sensor is a tire pressure monitoring sensor only any tire can use it but it is specific to tire pressure monitoring yes and then there would be specific chips for example uh there will be a chip that tesla orders which says that i want a chip for car vision so that i can go into uh self-driving cars okay i want to use this particular algorithm so that it is most efficient for my purposes now that chip is an application specific ic yes it is made specifically for one customer it is much costlier for that customer but customer may still want it for the competitive advantage yes object synthesis again logic synthesis okay i will do that yes is it a microcontroller yes stem cell it was a microcontroller yes okay so uh pressure yes logic synthesis involves uh so rtl would say that okay uh move data from resistor r1 to r2 add r1 plus r2 whatever something like this but how would you move data you need to have some buffer somewhere yes sir how do you add two numbers you need to have that propagate and generate thing coming in you will have to have something coming in to add two numbers yes sir so what would those gates be [Music] so rtl is almost like english language but finally silicon cannot understand english silicon would understand only some transistor language now okay so so we don't even go to understand language when you do logic synthesis we go to gate language so we come to arrive at a gate level net list we say that okay after this nand gate we will put an or gate and when these two nand gates outputs connect on this or gate inputs the output of this or gate is going to be a plus b that a plus b i need to now write into that so we'll convert all those melee machines and more machines and everything that is what is logic synthesis so implementing your english language or a program code into a gate level net list is it clearer yes sir so you do this logic synthesis then you do 10 synthesis once all that is done you know what kind of circuits and what is the total number of cells you need to put on your device you enter into a state which is called as float planning as to where would you put your processor where would you put your memory where would you put different parts of your chip okay i want the memory to be as close to the processor so that there is no delay in accessing the memory one could say that someone would say that i would want to put the pll on this corner of the shift so that it does not encounter any noise someone would say i want to put adc on this place so that is float planning you basically building a plan of how you would lay out your chip finally consider it like if you have to build a residential complex you need to plan where the five towers or residential towers have to be where the swimming pool has to be where the clubhouse has to be and so on so that is what is like float planning and after the while the floor planning is done you also do stuff like our estimation static timing analysis gate level synthesis and so on gate level simulation and so on so what does static timing analysis entail who will tell so this is you know that flip flops would have some setup time some hold time something so when the clock arrives the data should be set up so whether that is happening or not do you need to add some delay somewhere so it is largely timing verification timing characterization gate level simulation is once i've removed the english from a plus b and i've actually put an adder there after all that logic conversion is my net list still still operating the same way as i intended it to be okay then a structure verification is i wanted to have a scan chain built there i wanted to test different different components independently am i able to really test them then power estimation now sensitive actually you have real gates available there okay you have real gates available there you actually can estimate what kind of power consumption will happen and then you also check that okay or that there are two outputs driving one single node so or that there is some input that is floating or that there is a a load on a particular on a particular gate which it cannot even be able to hold so all these checks you do while you do these steps and as you complete these checks you also release your netlist which is now reasonably stable because it has met all these logical standards to the layout now you say ok this was where i wanted to put my tower one this was where i wanted to put my tower to now is the time to build the towers okay so now you will start to place the windows the walls and everything over there and you will and this is what you would be you this is the final shape of a residential complex and layout is essentially the final shape of your design so you start to put the layout of the and gate as to how it will appear on silicon you put the layout of the nor gate of the adder of everything of the memory so all those things you now start to put together and you now do timing driven layout optimization that okay the output of this and gate is going into this or gate so let me place this and gate and nor gate together okay so that is layout driven time timing driven layout optimizations once you have done that you again need to do static timing analysis because now where you now know the additional information of how long a wire is there between two different gates till now you only knew that this nand connects to that norm now you know that this when this man connects to that not there is also this longer wire in between them so the delays would change and you need to do a timing analysis all over again sir so i mean so the static timing analysis we did after the floor uh planning we were not we were not taking into account the routing today so you would use some model method there you would assume that okay most of the wires like you will use a statistical model based on your earlier analysis some other chips you had designed so you know that okay most of my wires were one micron in length and a few wires were 10 microns in length and very few wires were 100 microns in length so based on that you will statistically distribute those wire so this is called a wire load model you distribute those wire loads on some different places and you would do it but now you actually have the real wire length available with you okay okay so this is a more realistic analysis so you do sta all over again and you do post layout technology checks now that is drc clean as lvs clean is a uh is is every gate connected to a or every poly connected to a diode or a drain somewhere otherwise there could be uh you know antenna violations and the strip would fail after fabrication and all that stuff okay the the thing you said about if it's connected to the day in a diode was uh wasn't it a part of gate level simulation like you have diodes are not i would have no functionality per se so yeah how did we skip that in a game simulation because diode is not a gate what combinational logic does diode represent i mean it's just it just really acts as a switcher but like no you know the diodes that i am talking about here are so that due to fabrication there could be a lot of iron iron deposition on your polysilicon gates and you need to discharge them otherwise the gate breakdown will occur these are physical texts technology linked checks okay can you can you just elaborate on that for the little princess and we will look at that in more detail later but yeah so when you manufacture silicon you actually put very high energy uh you know uh how do i put it plasma onto your dies okay this can lead to a lot of charge buildup on your dice and that charge needs to be sunk into the substrate otherwise there can be dielectric breakdown somewhere because of very high voltage okay so every polysilicon gate needs to be connected to some drain or source some something like that so that that charge has a path to discharge this is not a part of logic synthesis at all rather you also wanted to ask something oh yes sir so this timing driven layout optimization are you is it a part of like the routing part like that yes placement uh place and route yes okay answer one more thing so this uh power estimation and the earlier power analysis that we've done just after design entry like uh estimation and analysis does have a different connotation or like does it have an accuracy it has a different connotation in the sense that when you did it the first time you you did not really have the exact numbers because you did not know the exact dates that would be used to implement your design you just saw that okay this processor is being accessed 2000 number of times can i reduce it somehow it was an architectural level thing so this memory is being accessed every cycle can i reduce the number of accesses to the memory okay okay okay so now you actually have the power consumption that happens in every cycle and now you're estimating it and now you can tell oh i still i i reduce it to 50 now i actually need to reduce it to 20 only okay so at the power estimation we are having the specific amount of power consumed every cycle like yeah because synthesis has happened now i know every device yes sir and so one more thing so that uh you have mentioned this uh clock synthesis before the flow planning generally enough flow we generally see that rocket and then the placement and uh uh planning for planning and the placement then we do the kind of this clock three synthesis but here you have put before you see synthesis synthesis uh would happen uh alongside floor planning actually so that is where the link is so test and clock synthesis leads to two things floor planning and this but you see that is a horizontal connector it could actually be happening in parallel also they feed into each other okay okay so can i just briefly explain this how these interconnections are made up between the different boxes you have made actually it's the beginning of it yeah so the ones for example static timing analysis gate level synthesis etcetera they're all running in parallel they do not so while sta has something to do with floor planning and other stuff gate level simulations has nothing to do with it so in the sta box i also show an entry of float planning but i do not show an entry of float planning into gate level sentences for example okay the output of sta goes for timing assertion it also goes for sds and rc and cap estimation and that information also come back to sda so that is also shown as an input there and an output there so uh if you look at if you look at these ones these are reverse loops that okay if after sta i realize that something is not working it means i will go back to this state i will redo the timing driven layout optimization okay if i notice that so when i release the netlist from here i also release timing assertions so that they can be used for timing driven layout optimization i release timing assertions to layout also so these are these are not just one way at least these ones over here they may not necessarily be one way routes there could be also both ways okay timing sessions are basically uh the adjustment of the timing we are doing after the sda so likewise if some gate is failing or not yes you may say that this this device is so far away from there that i need to put in some extra buffers in the other path okay or bring these two devices closer so that is the layout different timing optimization so yes action so so power estimation is done but before timing optimization as you can see in this alongside so you know sta is happening alongside sta and power estimation are happening in the parallel plane uh so sir i want to know that power in load and idle power also matters yes so so after uh like i can see that before releasing the phone found it there's no again power testing or something like when every optimization is done every kind of optimization there's no again power test or something yeah so what happens is uh you know when you actually go into chip designing you will notice that if you've done the you know gating and everything properly over here and you've done verification at gate level simulations and power estimation then after the layout not not really much would change buyers would change they will reflect into sta so you know as soon as you do this sdf and rf you again come back to this level so you do sta again you may you may want to do some other text of this place again that can happen but because there is some extra wire somewhere because of that power is not going to change from 1 milliwatt to 2 milliwatts it may go from 1 milliwatt to 1.01 milliwatts okay sir okay because some you had used some wire load model even initially and it's a fair you know based on a based on earlier products only it's not a random thing picked up from somewhere so many ics are have been designed till date that we have a fair amount of an idea that an ic of this complexity would use this kind of a wire load distribution so power estimation does not really change much after this stage okay sir because you already have the post layout library characterized now okay so what is a wireless model a wire load model okay so when i say that there are these many and gates and these many nand gates on a chip they need to be connected is it not should they be wires in between them these wires will lead to loading of your gates so what length of wire to assume between or what length of wire to assume at the output of a given given gate that is probabilistically set left corner so after you have finally designed your entire chip you will do a post layout extraction so you will see now finally what are my capacitances at different places and with those load capacitances now is my sta is my timing still correct or not if it is not you will go back to the sts stage and you will do a layout riddle and optimization all over again so there will be eco of some parts of your chip eco means engineering change order so some things you will need to change so that your delays and everything are still in that okay answer the block which represents a test structure verification is that connected to bfd and such things yes yes rather if you had a question your hand is raised uh yes sir so this uh can you just say there was a static time and recent timing assertion that so what's the difference here oh so static timing analysis said that okay before the layout i assume that there is some kind of a wire load on on between the two no in the between the two gates and i would say that this is what my uh timing is because i assumed some load now there could be some race conditions where the slack is very less so you will tell that oh i do not really have margins here so please do not increase the tap of this wire more than that so what do you what does that mean for the layout it means that these two cells have to be placed close together they cannot be kept far away okay so it's it's kind of a directive for the optimization that do this keeping this in mind yes there are timing assertions yes okay okay mother you have a question uh yes sir what's the difference between gate level simulation and test structure verification so gate level simulation would typically test only the functional modes okay test structure verification would typically test only the test modes i didn't get it so what's the difference what are the test modes and i mean uh let us look at it like this when i want to do a face recognition on an apple chip that is a function i will test that face recognition and i will say this is working fine or not however for for that particular chip i need to keep a memory which is let us say one kilo bit by uh you know one kilo words and 32 bits each word 1k cross 32 memory i need to pick during a functional mode i may not actually access every memory cell every memory location with both kind of data zero and one let us say so but this was just the test program that you wrote in reality when the customer face would actually come then the any bit can be zero and any bit can be one so for every memory you have to test every bit for both zero and one your test cases may not have everything when you when you're designing test cases only for the functional mode so you design a separate bist you add a built-in self-test into the overall system which would access the memory for every location and write zero and one on every location so that everything is tested now gate level simulation you don't run the best but in test structure verification you will test the best so now you're not changing the wireless model you're actually extracting the wire loads and putting that into the net list yes i'm changing the netlist from the no no again there is no model now now this is the real thing that you're putting back in there model was an estimate model was an extrapolation now this is the real thing you're putting real capacitance you're putting there okay yes between uh yeah sir so what you said about test structure verification you're testing every single possibility so is that um isn't that kind of expensive i mean you're testing it so you tell me if you have entered into a car you enter into a car which was tested only for good road conditions would you write so i mean you have to make test conditions which you know will accommodate to every type of yeah you know exactly so that is what test structure verification is but otherwise a gate level simulation is okay my car is starting fine it is receiving inputs from all the different sensors it is working fine that is gate level simulation uh so so for example when you're writing a computer code and you're testing it right so you will might have like a million different test cases but to accommodate each each function i mean you only you we need a limited number of test cases which test all the different possibilities so a test is a very very significant cost we will come to it we'll come to it later in this uh in the next section next lecture but test is a very significant cost you actually have to test it very exhaustively so if you are so even the gate level simulation you're testing for those test specifications you have given and then in test structure verification you are testing each possibility so what's the point of the previous step uh the point of the previous step is okay i just said that for memory you have a best there okay now i tested the memory with the best i know memory is functioning fine similarly i test the processor with its logic best all that logic is working fine do i not need to also test that the interface of memory and logic is working fine yeah yeah yes sir yeah so that is what is the purpose of gate level simulation that the functionality that you wanted you are getting that then s structure is each each component that you have put in itself is robust okay so gate level simulation is for the functionality and then test structure verification is you're going to find details that okay every single component is individually working fine yes okay okay so i have three people raising their hand mother divine so the question was once again related to test structure verification uh so in gates uh gate level simulation we know that uh our circuit has this particular function so with destructive verification we are basically pushing it to its limits and finding out if there is any error uh yes and no so in a gate level simulation i am connecting the processor and the memory and the all the different slaves of the processor and testing that everything as a system is working fine in test structure verification i am putting the best into question and saying that is my memory work only my memory working fine completely or not is my set of bank of flip flops working fine completely or not given whatever input set [Music] i want to build a car so at one point of time i tested that the car starts and it runs well okay and at another point of time i tested just the engine separately that it is giving me the horsepower that i require another test i'm testing only the tires that they are giving me the kind of uh grip that i require so one thing was system level testing the other thing is doing tests specific to the engine so that i am sure that engine will work even at minus 40 degree celsius and even at once 125 degree celsius uh separate modules are being tested yes so one thing is more about module level testing and ensuring that every module is well tested okay it also has some system level tests but gate level simulation is more about functional testing okay that all the required functionality is in there it's built in there so once you have that once you do then finally you do the atpg automatic test pattern generation and you release the stuff to the foundry but okay all my tests all my timings everything is closed my power is within the budget everything is fine please fabricate it okay and i tell you each block over here is a kind of an independent job in industry each of these blocks is an independent job now it may happen that there is a team that does all these five things so there are people who are doing all these five things that in one project or another so they get to get exposed to all these five things but uh it could also be in a particular case that one person is doing only this or this sti karaoke post layout stf that is the only thing he is doing that can also happen so each one each one of these is a specialized domain so orange yellow and green could be different teams or they could be actually independent jobs each block would be an independent job profile okay so i think we should stop here we will go to the abstraction levels in the next class okay any any pending questions that you forgot to ask so i have one so this after uh the yellow row uh so mostly still we i have not gone to the physical level we are still at the logical level yeah so but yes sir so but like in this after the starting time analysis you have connected it to the sdf rc and cap so what is that so sdf rc and cap are inputs from after the layout has been made back into static timing analysis okay so it's going the other way around not yet so anything else so what kind of checks are done during pre-layout technology during pre-layout technology tech street layout technology takes as i mentioned that okay uh even at the gate level net list my the load of any one of my gates is not greater than 220 fahrenheit that is kind of a pre-layout you don't even need to know the layout update you know that every gate has some input or capacitance so depending on what the fan out that you have connected you can estimate the overall load on any particular gate so these are like free layout technology checks quick estimates because if you need to do some buffering you do it right away so that the netlist already has it and then you release it to the layout okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7091-SZPFk,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7091-SZPFk
Transcript: give me a second i will pause the recording and i will come back again just give me a minute so once we have this you know good overview of how a chip starts from a requirement analysis to finally shipping we enter into this detail of how does the design implementation happen okay so the first stage of the design implementation is initial design entry where you say that okay i need this kind of memory i need this kind of a processor i need this kind of interfaces ddrs and so on and then you do a design entry this design entry is an rtl okay you write a verilog code and that is rtl once you've done the design entry you need to verify that this design is meeting the functionality that you wanted it to meet so do you simulate the rtl and do a quick power analysis that the power budget is also within the you know specified range after that is done you do the logic synthesis now what what do you understand about logic synthesis there was already a question earlier about logic synthesis and layout so what do you understand by logic synthesis it is mapping our uh rtl code to the gate gate level net list [Music] so it is converting an rtl verilog netlist into a gate level net list that okay you just said an adder but an adder is implemented by using these kind of ands and rs and xor gates okay so that implementation is synthesis after the logic synthesis is done you do test and clock synthesis what do you think test and clock synthesis entails uh sir so like uh when we test our code like when we're stimulating so you know you're using a clock signal that you have provided but to actually generate a clock which will run in that system you need to do a block system as well right okay i mean it should uh run at 2.5 megahertz so yeah so let us look at it like this in the logic synthesis you said you will put 1 million flip flops on your chip and for every flip flop you simply put the clock pin am i right in reality clock will be generated by some pll somewhere or you will get it from outside your chip so there is one point on the chip there you will have the clock generated and do you think that one point can drive all the one million flip flops no so we have dog buffers right i mean so you have to now arrange and organize these flip flops in a particular way that okay these ten flip flops this buffer would drive these ten flip flops another buffer would drive so this part of inserting clock buffers so that none of the clock pins or none of the clock signals nodes has a load more than let us say 100 front of arrows additionally you know all the matched clock nodes uh clock ends arrive at almost the same delay so if if there is one flip flop and another flip flop which was supposed to work simultaneously it should not happen that because i put 10 buffers in one path and five in the other path one swap operated much faster than much earlier than the other one so if they were expected to operate synchronously and simultaneously i have to put 10 buffers on both the paths so this is clock synthesis similarly as we talked about you know initial functional specification and testification we look at test synthesis that as to how will i make those scan chains how will i test the entire chip once it is fabricated so at this early stage itself when when you just add the logic synthesis stage or just right after that you start to also do the test synthesis you start to insert some test features also rather you have a question yes sir sir in this clock synthesis are you referring to the clock tree synthesis yes and so one more thing so like after the design entry you have mentioned the power analysis so but design entry is in the rtl form so we still don't have a kind of uh the components that will be involved so what kind of power analysis that they're doing here like how would we know that what kind of power can be considered let us say i i said that i will use a memory somewhere okay and i have not gated the access to the memory so memory every clock cycle memory is being accessed i know that a memory will consume more power i have models for memory also so in that case then what we see is in that case what we see is that your system will show that the power consumption is high that you need to do power gating at some places to reduce overall power consumption so you can change your rtl so that clock dating happens and memory is not accessed every cycle it is only fs when needed so but my question is like rtl at the rt level we still have we are having only a behavior model so like yeah but you okay so it is not just behavioral model so the models that you have you know the very long models that you have many times they are also associated with uh some top-level information on power consumption and timings okay okay like apart from the net list also yes okay so okay um so so it's a about you know designing a chair so uh it could be an asic it could be a assp it could be anything it could be a standard product all together a commodity product not even an asic and not even an assp it is a standard chip anything so you know the difference between asics and asses and standard yes yes i mean i i don't know what you're referring to by standard chips like for example uh atmel uh atmel 32 processor is a standard chip it is available off the shelf anyone can come to the market and purchase it stm32 is a standard chip anyone can come it is not defined or prepared for a particular application whereas for example corus is a product from st which is a specific chip for automotive industry but it is again standard it was not made specifically for bosch it was not made specifically for rolls-royce it was just made so that any user any um car manufacturer can use it okay so you're saying that uh it's like programmable it can be programmed as to the needs of the customer what about programming no no it is not just about programming it is about application for example stm32 is a standard product it could be used across any application whether you use it in a car you can use stm32 whether you use it in your alexa you can use an stm32 whether it is google home you can use stm32 any application can use stm32 even your smartwatch can use stm32 okay so any range of applications it could be automotive it could even be a satellite it could be using stm32 so it is off the shelf available standard product however when i'm talking about let us say an automotive specific product then that product is designed for a particular use inside cars only for example tire tire pressure monitoring sensor yes now tpms you will not use in your watch will you no it will only be used in automotive sector but it is not designed specifically for bosch it is a standard product so it is application specific standard product assp so but like the features are somewhat to save right i mean okay you can you can only do these amount of things in this ship i mean and those those amount of operations can be used in a car or in a watch or anywhere but it's still fixed you cannot you cannot change it you cannot like uh it's not steel programmable like fpga yeah for example uh so that is that there are multiple flavors of let us say stm32 some flavors would have one kilobyte of non-volatile memory some flavors would have 32 kilobytes some would have one megabit okay so that will limit what all you can store and what all so that would change stuff but otherwise it is stm32 to the standard product okay right okay but assp is application specific standard product now tire pressure monitoring sensor is a tire pressure monitoring sensor only any tire can use it but it is specific to tire pressure monitoring yes and then there would be specific chips for example uh there will be a chip that tesla orders which says that i want a chip for car vision so that i can go into uh self-driving cars okay i want to use this particular algorithm so that it is most efficient for my purposes now that chip is an application specific ic yes it is made specifically for one customer it is much costlier for that customer but customer may still want it for the competitive advantage yes object synthesis again logic synthesis okay i will do that yes is it a microcontroller yes stem cell it was a microcontroller yes okay so uh pressure yes logic synthesis involves uh so rtl would say that okay uh move data from resistor r1 to r2 add r1 plus r2 whatever something like this but how would you move data you need to have some buffer somewhere yes sir how do you add two numbers you need to have that propagate and generate thing coming in you will have to have something coming in to add two numbers yes sir so what would those gates be [Music] so rtl is almost like english language but finally silicon cannot understand english silicon would understand only some transistor language now okay so so we don't even go to understand language when you do logic synthesis we go to gate language so we come to arrive at a gate level net list we say that okay after this nand gate we will put an or gate and when these two nand gates outputs connect on this or gate inputs the output of this or gate is going to be a plus b that a plus b i need to now write into that so we'll convert all those melee machines and more machines and everything that is what is logic synthesis so implementing your english language or a program code into a gate level net list is it clearer yes sir so you do this logic synthesis then you do 10 synthesis once all that is done you know what kind of circuits and what is the total number of cells you need to put on your device you enter into a state which is called as float planning as to where would you put your processor where would you put your memory where would you put different parts of your chip okay i want the memory to be as close to the processor so that there is no delay in accessing the memory one could say that someone would say that i would want to put the pll on this corner of the shift so that it does not encounter any noise someone would say i want to put adc on this place so that is float planning you basically building a plan of how you would lay out your chip finally consider it like if you have to build a residential complex you need to plan where the five towers or residential towers have to be where the swimming pool has to be where the clubhouse has to be and so on so that is what is like float planning and after the while the floor planning is done you also do stuff like our estimation static timing analysis gate level synthesis and so on gate level simulation and so on so what does static timing analysis entail who will tell so this is you know that flip flops would have some setup time some hold time something so when the clock arrives the data should be set up so whether that is happening or not do you need to add some delay somewhere so it is largely timing verification timing characterization gate level simulation is once i've removed the english from a plus b and i've actually put an adder there after all that logic conversion is my net list still still operating the same way as i intended it to be okay then a structure verification is i wanted to have a scan chain built there i wanted to test different different components independently am i able to really test them then power estimation now sensitive actually you have real gates available there okay you have real gates available there you actually can estimate what kind of power consumption will happen and then you also check that okay or that there are two outputs driving one single node so or that there is some input that is floating or that there is a a load on a particular on a particular gate which it cannot even be able to hold so all these checks you do while you do these steps and as you complete these checks you also release your netlist which is now reasonably stable because it has met all these logical standards to the layout now you say ok this was where i wanted to put my tower one this was where i wanted to put my tower to now is the time to build the towers okay so now you will start to place the windows the walls and everything over there and you will and this is what you would be you this is the final shape of a residential complex and layout is essentially the final shape of your design so you start to put the layout of the and gate as to how it will appear on silicon you put the layout of the nor gate of the adder of everything of the memory so all those things you now start to put together and you now do timing driven layout optimization that okay the output of this and gate is going into this or gate so let me place this and gate and nor gate together okay so that is layout driven time timing driven layout optimizations once you have done that you again need to do static timing analysis because now where you now know the additional information of how long a wire is there between two different gates till now you only knew that this nand connects to that norm now you know that this when this man connects to that not there is also this longer wire in between them so the delays would change and you need to do a timing analysis all over again sir so i mean so the static timing analysis we did after the floor uh planning we were not we were not taking into account the routing today so you would use some model method there you would assume that okay most of the wires like you will use a statistical model based on your earlier analysis some other chips you had designed so you know that okay most of my wires were one micron in length and a few wires were 10 microns in length and very few wires were 100 microns in length so based on that you will statistically distribute those wire so this is called a wire load model you distribute those wire loads on some different places and you would do it but now you actually have the real wire length available with you okay okay so this is a more realistic analysis so you do sta all over again and you do post layout technology checks now that is drc clean as lvs clean is a uh is is every gate connected to a or every poly connected to a diode or a drain somewhere otherwise there could be uh you know antenna violations and the strip would fail after fabrication and all that stuff okay the the thing you said about if it's connected to the day in a diode was uh wasn't it a part of gate level simulation like you have diodes are not i would have no functionality per se so yeah how did we skip that in a game simulation because diode is not a gate what combinational logic does diode represent i mean it's just it just really acts as a switcher but like no you know the diodes that i am talking about here are so that due to fabrication there could be a lot of iron iron deposition on your polysilicon gates and you need to discharge them otherwise the gate breakdown will occur these are physical texts technology linked checks okay can you can you just elaborate on that for the little princess and we will look at that in more detail later but yeah so when you manufacture silicon you actually put very high energy uh you know uh how do i put it plasma onto your dies okay this can lead to a lot of charge buildup on your dice and that charge needs to be sunk into the substrate otherwise there can be dielectric breakdown somewhere because of very high voltage okay so every polysilicon gate needs to be connected to some drain or source some something like that so that that charge has a path to discharge this is not a part of logic synthesis at all rather you also wanted to ask something oh yes sir so this timing driven layout optimization are you is it a part of like the routing part like that yes placement uh place and route yes okay answer one more thing so this uh power estimation and the earlier power analysis that we've done just after design entry like uh estimation and analysis does have a different connotation or like does it have an accuracy it has a different connotation in the sense that when you did it the first time you you did not really have the exact numbers because you did not know the exact dates that would be used to implement your design you just saw that okay this processor is being accessed 2000 number of times can i reduce it somehow it was an architectural level thing so this memory is being accessed every cycle can i reduce the number of accesses to the memory okay okay okay so now you actually have the power consumption that happens in every cycle and now you're estimating it and now you can tell oh i still i i reduce it to 50 now i actually need to reduce it to 20 only okay so at the power estimation we are having the specific amount of power consumed every cycle like yeah because synthesis has happened now i know every device yes sir and so one more thing so that uh you have mentioned this uh clock synthesis before the flow planning generally enough flow we generally see that rocket and then the placement and uh uh planning for planning and the placement then we do the kind of this clock three synthesis but here you have put before you see synthesis synthesis uh would happen uh alongside floor planning actually so that is where the link is so test and clock synthesis leads to two things floor planning and this but you see that is a horizontal connector it could actually be happening in parallel also they feed into each other okay okay so can i just briefly explain this how these interconnections are made up between the different boxes you have made actually it's the beginning of it yeah so the ones for example static timing analysis gate level synthesis etcetera they're all running in parallel they do not so while sta has something to do with floor planning and other stuff gate level simulations has nothing to do with it so in the sta box i also show an entry of float planning but i do not show an entry of float planning into gate level sentences for example okay the output of sta goes for timing assertion it also goes for sds and rc and cap estimation and that information also come back to sda so that is also shown as an input there and an output there so uh if you look at if you look at these ones these are reverse loops that okay if after sta i realize that something is not working it means i will go back to this state i will redo the timing driven layout optimization okay if i notice that so when i release the netlist from here i also release timing assertions so that they can be used for timing driven layout optimization i release timing assertions to layout also so these are these are not just one way at least these ones over here they may not necessarily be one way routes there could be also both ways okay timing sessions are basically uh the adjustment of the timing we are doing after the sda so likewise if some gate is failing or not yes you may say that this this device is so far away from there that i need to put in some extra buffers in the other path okay or bring these two devices closer so that is the layout different timing optimization so yes action so so power estimation is done but before timing optimization as you can see in this alongside so you know sta is happening alongside sta and power estimation are happening in the parallel plane uh so sir i want to know that power in load and idle power also matters yes so so after uh like i can see that before releasing the phone found it there's no again power testing or something like when every optimization is done every kind of optimization there's no again power test or something yeah so what happens is uh you know when you actually go into chip designing you will notice that if you've done the you know gating and everything properly over here and you've done verification at gate level simulations and power estimation then after the layout not not really much would change buyers would change they will reflect into sta so you know as soon as you do this sdf and rf you again come back to this level so you do sta again you may you may want to do some other text of this place again that can happen but because there is some extra wire somewhere because of that power is not going to change from 1 milliwatt to 2 milliwatts it may go from 1 milliwatt to 1.01 milliwatts okay sir okay because some you had used some wire load model even initially and it's a fair you know based on a based on earlier products only it's not a random thing picked up from somewhere so many ics are have been designed till date that we have a fair amount of an idea that an ic of this complexity would use this kind of a wire load distribution so power estimation does not really change much after this stage okay sir because you already have the post layout library characterized now okay so what is a wireless model a wire load model okay so when i say that there are these many and gates and these many nand gates on a chip they need to be connected is it not should they be wires in between them these wires will lead to loading of your gates so what length of wire to assume between or what length of wire to assume at the output of a given given gate that is probabilistically set left corner so after you have finally designed your entire chip you will do a post layout extraction so you will see now finally what are my capacitances at different places and with those load capacitances now is my sta is my timing still correct or not if it is not you will go back to the sts stage and you will do a layout riddle and optimization all over again so there will be eco of some parts of your chip eco means engineering change order so some things you will need to change so that your delays and everything are still in that okay answer the block which represents a test structure verification is that connected to bfd and such things yes yes rather if you had a question your hand is raised uh yes sir so this uh can you just say there was a static time and recent timing assertion that so what's the difference here oh so static timing analysis said that okay before the layout i assume that there is some kind of a wire load on on between the two no in the between the two gates and i would say that this is what my uh timing is because i assumed some load now there could be some race conditions where the slack is very less so you will tell that oh i do not really have margins here so please do not increase the tap of this wire more than that so what do you what does that mean for the layout it means that these two cells have to be placed close together they cannot be kept far away okay so it's it's kind of a directive for the optimization that do this keeping this in mind yes there are timing assertions yes okay okay mother you have a question uh yes sir what's the difference between gate level simulation and test structure verification so gate level simulation would typically test only the functional modes okay test structure verification would typically test only the test modes i didn't get it so what's the difference what are the test modes and i mean uh let us look at it like this when i want to do a face recognition on an apple chip that is a function i will test that face recognition and i will say this is working fine or not however for for that particular chip i need to keep a memory which is let us say one kilo bit by uh you know one kilo words and 32 bits each word 1k cross 32 memory i need to pick during a functional mode i may not actually access every memory cell every memory location with both kind of data zero and one let us say so but this was just the test program that you wrote in reality when the customer face would actually come then the any bit can be zero and any bit can be one so for every memory you have to test every bit for both zero and one your test cases may not have everything when you when you're designing test cases only for the functional mode so you design a separate bist you add a built-in self-test into the overall system which would access the memory for every location and write zero and one on every location so that everything is tested now gate level simulation you don't run the best but in test structure verification you will test the best so now you're not changing the wireless model you're actually extracting the wire loads and putting that into the net list yes i'm changing the netlist from the no no again there is no model now now this is the real thing that you're putting back in there model was an estimate model was an extrapolation now this is the real thing you're putting real capacitance you're putting there okay yes between uh yeah sir so what you said about test structure verification you're testing every single possibility so is that um isn't that kind of expensive i mean you're testing it so you tell me if you have entered into a car you enter into a car which was tested only for good road conditions would you write so i mean you have to make test conditions which you know will accommodate to every type of yeah you know exactly so that is what test structure verification is but otherwise a gate level simulation is okay my car is starting fine it is receiving inputs from all the different sensors it is working fine that is gate level simulation uh so so for example when you're writing a computer code and you're testing it right so you will might have like a million different test cases but to accommodate each each function i mean you only you we need a limited number of test cases which test all the different possibilities so a test is a very very significant cost we will come to it we'll come to it later in this uh in the next section next lecture but test is a very significant cost you actually have to test it very exhaustively so if you are so even the gate level simulation you're testing for those test specifications you have given and then in test structure verification you are testing each possibility so what's the point of the previous step uh the point of the previous step is okay i just said that for memory you have a best there okay now i tested the memory with the best i know memory is functioning fine similarly i test the processor with its logic best all that logic is working fine do i not need to also test that the interface of memory and logic is working fine yeah yeah yes sir yeah so that is what is the purpose of gate level simulation that the functionality that you wanted you are getting that then s structure is each each component that you have put in itself is robust okay so gate level simulation is for the functionality and then test structure verification is you're going to find details that okay every single component is individually working fine yes okay okay so i have three people raising their hand mother divine so the question was once again related to test structure verification uh so in gates uh gate level simulation we know that uh our circuit has this particular function so with destructive verification we are basically pushing it to its limits and finding out if there is any error uh yes and no so in a gate level simulation i am connecting the processor and the memory and the all the different slaves of the processor and testing that everything as a system is working fine in test structure verification i am putting the best into question and saying that is my memory work only my memory working fine completely or not is my set of bank of flip flops working fine completely or not given whatever input set [Music] i want to build a car so at one point of time i tested that the car starts and it runs well okay and at another point of time i tested just the engine separately that it is giving me the horsepower that i require another test i'm testing only the tires that they are giving me the kind of uh grip that i require so one thing was system level testing the other thing is doing tests specific to the engine so that i am sure that engine will work even at minus 40 degree celsius and even at once 125 degree celsius uh separate modules are being tested yes so one thing is more about module level testing and ensuring that every module is well tested okay it also has some system level tests but gate level simulation is more about functional testing okay that all the required functionality is in there it's built in there so once you have that once you do then finally you do the atpg automatic test pattern generation and you release the stuff to the foundry but okay all my tests all my timings everything is closed my power is within the budget everything is fine please fabricate it okay and i tell you each block over here is a kind of an independent job in industry each of these blocks is an independent job now it may happen that there is a team that does all these five things so there are people who are doing all these five things that in one project or another so they get to get exposed to all these five things but uh it could also be in a particular case that one person is doing only this or this sti karaoke post layout stf that is the only thing he is doing that can also happen so each one each one of these is a specialized domain so orange yellow and green could be different teams or they could be actually independent jobs each block would be an independent job profile okay so i think we should stop here we will go to the abstraction levels in the next class okay any any pending questions that you forgot to ask so i have one so this after uh the yellow row uh so mostly still we i have not gone to the physical level we are still at the logical level yeah so but yes sir so but like in this after the starting time analysis you have connected it to the sdf rc and cap so what is that so sdf rc and cap are inputs from after the layout has been made back into static timing analysis okay so it's going the other way around not yet so anything else so what kind of checks are done during pre-layout technology during pre-layout technology tech street layout technology takes as i mentioned that okay uh even at the gate level net list my the load of any one of my gates is not greater than 220 fahrenheit that is kind of a pre-layout you don't even need to know the layout update you know that every gate has some input or capacitance so depending on what the fan out that you have connected you can estimate the overall load on any particular gate so these are like free layout technology checks quick estimates because if you need to do some buffering you do it right away so that the netlist already has it and then you release it to the layout okay"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,rq15h18pxbk,so we come back to the course so what were we doing in the last class what did we do look at the trip design flow with logarithmic design flow from requirement analysis to shipping to the customer and we looked at various stages of the design implementation phase where we saw that things have to be analyzed as they have to be uh simulated verified many times before you know even the layouts are made and after the layouts are made they are again verified again simulated and show that all the timing sign offs are fine and then we tape it out so this much we had done in the last class today we will start to look at a different abstraction of uh design flow where we are not really talking about uh entire chip we're talking more of more of it in terms of libraries this could be talked up talked about also in terms of chip but uh i'm i'm talking it in terms of libraries because while we are still having the specification phase here while we still have the behavioral understanding phase here and an rtl kind of a phase here what we also are saying is that we will go to circuit and layout stage okay so in terms of design level the language that is used for specification is common english behavioral description is typically a verilog code which is an executable program rtl is a sequential machine and a machine representation of the design that you are looking at you synthesize the rtl and you come to the stage of logic gates and those logic gates are actually implemented by using transistors and these transistors are actually implemented on silicon in the form of a layout which appears to be sets of rectangles overlapping you know one over another so that you can create transistors so in this particular course we will actually go from logic down to layout stage okay so what are the units in which we talk of when we talk of uh any level of abstraction so when when you are at the level of behavioral understanding or rtl you talk of it in terms of throughput and number of clock cycles taken when you go to logic you talk of how many inputs that is literals and uh logic depth okay how many number of stages are we talking about when you come to circuits you measure its efficacy in terms of speed in terms of nanoseconds power in terms of microwatts leakage in terms of microamperes or amperes and so on okay and layout you measure in terms of area in terms of microns or micron square yes uh so in the starting we said that we are now moving to a library view in the library design flow yeah yes so what exactly uh how is this like what do you mean by library here exactly okay libraries uh so okay you you know programming something you know so what is math.h so it's a header file that contain p processor it's already available to you you do not need to create it every time you write a c program do you no sir yeah so a library is something like that see when you're going for a soft design see last time there was a question key will we make so many millions of transistors by hand remember last time there was a question so no you don't really need to do that what is done is a library is created which is a collection of uh different views of different gates a different logic different implementations okay and then that is used by uh by the chip designer when they are designing the chips if we come back to the same example as we had about a residential complex then we said that floor planning is like defining which place would have which tower you remember that example that we discussed in the last class when we were talking about chip design flow yes sir where there would be a swimming pool and everything now let's say we're talking about building a tower so i'm talking about building a microprocessor microprocessor is one component that goes on that particular chip so this tower is one one such component that goes into this residential complex now come to think of this builder will he build will he start to make everything like from bricks onwards uh on the site or will he procure bricks from outside and simply start building the building so that is something like what we are talking about uh that for a standard for a sock designer uh for a system level designer he need not worry about how the bricks are built so we will give them gates and we will give them a library of gates so you will have bricks you will have windows you will have glass panes you will have those all these could be prefabricated and you can simply put them into your building as the structure builds up you know in the same manner we will already give you and gates nand gates a range of and or invert or r and invert gates adders multipliers and a whole range of such material which you can directly use as soon as you start your soc design so as an soc designer you need not worry about uh how how many layers i have put there or nothing you simply use these gates you're not really worried about exact layout of the transistors you're more worried about the logic part and the logic depth and so on okay okay so these are these dot dot lift files that the fast dot live or the slow dot left that we use to while doing kind of doing the love by converting from rtl to netlist no so dot lip files are simply characterization of these gates that we have designed the library that we have designed okay dot lib file is simply a characterization we'll just come to that don't worry in the next slide we will look at that also but uh library library is a collection so uh i would say look at it like a constellation of various cells our zodiac is a collection of twelve constellations from these two pisces okay similarly a library would be a collection of various functionalities which is which is available in one group each of these constellations each of these say aries or pisces will have their own set of stars and will and and can have their own impact on human behavior you know that is what astrology is all about whether you believe it or not that's good so i believe there is someone who believes in it and this is what they are saying so each of these libraries each of these cells whether it is an and cell or an and cell or a adder or whatever they have their own behavior they have their own characteristics so that characteristic and that behavior is encapsulated or described in the dot lip files rather yes sir okay but that that dot lift file is not the library the library is that zodiac which includes all the 12 uh stuffs okay okay so it's uh the dotted file is basically a subset of that yes okay small subset okay okay okay okay anything else so one more thing so in this uh can you also throw some light on this design time and the logic depth at the behavior and the logic level uh so if you do the computer architecture course you will get that idea don't worry okay okay so so logic depth is how many status in one particular pipeline stage how many how many stages of logic go in every pipeline stage design time is about how quickly you can design something or what time does it take to execute the program on your you know the number of clock cycles and all that so that that is that is in computer architecture course that you will get the handle on okay okay okay can i lower your hand raga sir sure uh what would decide behavior i'm sorry moan i miss what exactly is throughput throughput means how many how many instructions you can execute per cycle or per second again computer architecture this is the higher so in this course dvd courses is let us say here onwards and what you're talking about over here is ca what we did in the last class was covered in well well the entire flow would be covered in the vdf course is that okay doughnut if you have a question yes sir behavioral it is high level synthesis so behave that is uh just that instead of writing your behavioral code in very long you've written that in c or c plus plus and then from c to c plus plus you go towards the rtl phase by using high level synthesis flow okay yes okay so we move forward if you've not yet started dvd actually we're just talking about what is around dvd but it's important because you should know where we are it's important to have the overall context would be automated like you have a circuit design and a floor plan can it be automated so floor plan uh at the rt at the stock level is already automated uh when we talk of uh when we talk of floor plan or layout design at standard cell level you can automate it but it can lead to area loss because automation can lead to some loss of area and therefore we would want to avoid that area is so i have not yet used this thing over here in this class but in vlsi area is gold so we don't want to lose gold so typically we would design layouts by hands in this course definitely you will design them by hand but yes you can automate them but those libraries are not usually dense enough at least the automation has not reach that level of ns that they can match human design but with more and more constricting drc's coming into picture probably we will get very good layouts even by automation akash you have a question yes sir actually in the refresher module we have studied very long in which we have implemented this like behavior level uh suppose uh we have implemented full adder using behavior level then converted into in this synthesizable level so how could we relate this very log to computer architecture so uh verilog is you just look are looking at an adder part of it so you are not able to relate it but when you look at a processor a processor would have adder it would have a lot of other combinational blocks it would have a complete alu in itself is it not yes so that also you would write in the behavioral description and that is what you will cover in ca i am not saying that ca is going to teach you very log what i am saying is the concept of throughput and design time or function unit and clock cycles is being covered in the ca course that is where you talk about sequential machines and executable programs and so on verilog doesn't mean uh you're always just behavioral or whether it doesn't mean that it is being taught in c no ca will not teach you very long okay okay see a very long you have to learn yourself you have a question uh yes sir so what do you mean but i mean i don't understand why layout is in a lower level than circuit i mean uh what so what here what are we what do we exactly mean by layout because uh i'm sorry as we go lower and lower we are coming very close to silicon technology okay so circuit is a schematic that you have in p spice even if you're not done you know virtuoso schematic you would have done piece 5 schematics earlier i think all of you have already used virtuoso by now am i right yeah so that is just a schematic uh you you what do you do in a schematic you simply create a rectangle or a symbol like this and say this is a pmos but if you cannot draw this on silicon and say for silicon you need to have a layout view where this would be the polysilicon gate and one of this will be source the other part will be drained right okay so this is much closer to silicon this you can actually implement on silicon this you cannot so by layout we mean the actual implementation on hardware no my layout we mean a set of tad layers which if you convert them into masks you can implement this particular functionality that you have specified on the silicon onto hardware so there is an entire fabrication process that is that has to happen after that also right right okay so yeah layout is basic so we can implement those circuits uh with the help of masks on those silicon vehicles yes we will fabricate not implement we'll fabricate fabricate is the correct product right uh and one more question when we when we say function units we mean something like at the abstraction level of say an adder or something like that and then logic is basically a disorder gate and the and gate you use yeah so when you're talking about function unit you may talk about uh 1000 max multiply and accumulate msc units yeah yeah good good okay so shakti is asking should we do verification after each step of design abstraction yes whenever you're doing a handoff to a different team you have to verify your stuff it may actually be a different team working on the on the different abstraction so before you hand off from your team to the other team you have to verify there is no two ways about it is that okay yes sir yes sir ranjit here so i have a doubt sir when we look at the top level specification and we look at the design we follow this top top-down approach we first look at the specification design the behavior and model and synthesize to rtl and so on but when we look at the prerequisites for each and every design abstraction suppose we we take the case of a circuit so for that uh the layout is prerequisite or if we take a logic design then layout is not a prerequisite you design a circuit and after you ensure that the circuit is fine then you go to the layout phase so suppose if we take the abstraction of logic suppose if we want to uh design a nand gate then we need the uh transistors so this is this way like this would be we will come to that detailed level of description in the next slide would you want to wait till then uh yes sir i can wait from logic to layout you're coming in the next slide yeah yeah thank you sir,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq15h18pxbk,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq15h18pxbk

mean by library here exactly okay libraries uh so okay you you know programming something you know so what is math.h so it's a header file that contain p processor it's already available to you you do not need to create it every time you write a c program do you no sir yeah so a library is something like that see when you're going for a soft design see last time there was a question key will we make so many millions of transistors by hand remember last time there was a question so no you don't really need to do that what is done is a library is created which is a collection of uh different views of different gates a different logic different implementations okay and then that is used by uh by the chip designer when they are designing the chips if we come back to the same example as we had about a residential complex then we said that floor planning is like defining which place would have which tower you remember that example that we discussed in the last class when we were talking about chip design flow yes sir where there would be a swimming pool and everything now let's say we're talking about building a tower so i'm talking about building a microprocessor microprocessor is one component that goes on that particular chip so this tower is one one such component that goes into this residential complex now come to think of this builder will he build will he start to make everything like from bricks onwards uh on the site or will he procure bricks from outside and simply start building the building so that is something like what we are talking about uh that for a standard for a sock designer uh for a system level designer he need not worry about how the bricks are built so we will give them gates and we will give them a library of gates so you will have bricks you will have windows you will have glass panes you will have those all these could be prefabricated and you can simply put them into your building as the structure builds up you know in the same manner we will already give you and gates nand gates a range of and or invert or r and invert gates adders multipliers and a whole range of such material which you can directly use as soon as you start your soc design so as an soc designer you need not worry about uh how how many layers i have put there or nothing you simply use these gates you're not really worried about exact layout of the transistors you're more worried about the logic part and the logic depth and so on okay okay so these are these dot dot lift files that the fast dot live or the slow dot left that we use to while doing kind of doing the love by converting from rtl to netlist no so dot lip files are simply characterization of these gates that we have designed the library that we have designed okay dot lib file is simply a characterization we'll just come to that don't worry in the next slide we will look at that also but uh library library is a collection so uh i would say look at it like a constellation of various cells our zodiac is a collection of twelve constellations from these two pisces okay similarly a library would be a collection of various functionalities which is which is available in one group each of these constellations each of these say aries or pisces will have their own set of stars and will and and can have their own impact on human behavior you know that is what astrology is all about whether you believe it or not that's good so i believe there is someone who believes in it and this is what they are saying so each of these libraries each of these cells whether it is an and cell or an and cell or a adder or whatever they have their own behavior they have their own characteristics so that characteristic and that behavior is encapsulated or described in the dot lip files rather yes sir okay but that that dot lift file is not the library the library is that zodiac which includes all the 12 uh stuffs okay okay so it's uh the dotted file is basically a subset of that yes okay small subset okay okay okay okay anything else so one more thing so in this uh can you also throw some light on this design time and the logic depth at the behavior and the logic level uh so if you do the computer architecture course you will get that idea don't worry okay okay so so logic depth is how many status in one particular pipeline stage how many how many stages of logic go in every pipeline stage design time is about how quickly you can design something or what time does it take to execute the program on your you know the number of clock cycles and all that so that that is that is in computer architecture course that you will get the handle on okay okay okay can i lower your hand raga sir sure uh what would decide behavior i'm sorry moan i miss what exactly is throughput throughput means how many how many instructions you can execute per cycle or per second again computer architecture this is the higher so in this course dvd courses is let us say here onwards and what you're talking about over here is ca what we did in the last class was covered in well well the entire flow would be covered in the vdf course is that okay doughnut if you have a question yes sir behavioral it is high level synthesis so behave that is uh just that instead of writing your behavioral code in very long you've written that in c or c plus plus and then from c to c plus plus you go towards the rtl phase by using high level synthesis flow okay yes okay so we move forward if you've not yet started dvd actually we're just talking about what is around dvd but it's important because you should know where we are it's important to have the overall context would be automated like you have a circuit design and a floor plan can it be automated so floor plan uh at the rt at the stock level is already automated uh when we talk of uh when we talk of floor plan or layout design at standard cell level you can automate it but it can lead to area loss because automation can lead to some loss of area and therefore we would want to avoid that area is so i have not yet used this thing over here in this class but in vlsi area is gold so we don't want to lose gold so typically we would design layouts by hands in this course definitely you will design them by hand but yes you can automate them but those libraries are not usually dense enough at least the automation has not reach that level of ns that they can match human design but with more and more constricting drc's coming into picture probably we will get very good layouts even by automation akash you have a question yes sir actually in the refresher module we have studied very long in which we have implemented this like behavior level uh suppose uh we have implemented full adder using behavior level then converted into in this synthesizable level so how could we relate this very log to computer architecture so uh verilog is you just look are looking at an adder part of it so you are not able to relate it but when you look at a processor a processor would have adder it would have a lot of other combinational blocks it would have a complete alu in itself is it not yes so that also you would write in the behavioral description and that is what you will cover in ca i am not saying that ca is going to teach you very log what i am saying is the concept of throughput and design time or function unit and clock cycles is being covered in the ca course that is where you talk about sequential machines and executable programs and so on verilog doesn't mean uh you're always just behavioral or whether it doesn't mean that it is being taught in c no ca will not teach you very long okay okay see a very long you have to learn yourself you have a question uh yes sir so what do you mean but i mean i don't understand why layout is in a lower level than circuit i mean uh what so what here what are we what do we exactly mean by layout because uh i'm sorry as we go lower and lower we are coming very close to silicon technology okay so circuit is a schematic that you have in p spice even if you're not done you know virtuoso schematic you would have done piece 5 schematics earlier i think all of you have already used virtuoso by now am i right yeah so that is just a schematic uh you you what do you do in a schematic you simply create a rectangle or a symbol like this and say this is a pmos but if you cannot draw this on silicon and say for silicon you need to have a layout view where this would be the polysilicon gate and one of this will be source the other part will be drained right okay so this is much closer to silicon this you can actually implement on silicon this you cannot so by layout we mean the actual implementation on hardware no my layout we mean a set of tad layers which if you convert them into masks you can implement this particular functionality that you have specified on the silicon onto hardware so there is an entire fabrication process that is that has to happen after that also right right okay so yeah layout is basic so we can implement those circuits uh with the help of masks on those silicon vehicles yes we will fabricate not implement we'll fabricate fabricate is the correct product right uh and one more question when we when we say function units we mean something like at the abstraction level of say an adder or something like that and then logic is basically a disorder gate and the and gate you use yeah so when you're talking about function unit you may talk about uh 1000 max multiply and accumulate msc units yeah yeah good good okay so shakti is asking should we do verification after each step of design abstraction yes whenever you're doing a handoff to a different team you have to verify your stuff it may actually be a different team working on the on the different abstraction so before you hand off from your team to the other team you have to verify there is no two ways about it is that okay yes sir yes sir ranjit here so i have a doubt sir when we look at the top level specification and we look at the design we follow this top top-down approach we first look at the specification design the behavior and model and synthesize to rtl and so on but when we look at the prerequisites for each and every design abstraction suppose we we take the case of a circuit so for that uh the layout is prerequisite or if we take a logic design then layout is not a prerequisite you design a circuit and after you ensure that the circuit is fine then you go to the layout phase so suppose if we take the abstraction of logic suppose if we want to uh design a nand gate then we need the uh transistors so this is this way like this would be we will come to that detailed level of description in the next slide would you want to wait till then uh yes sir i can wait from logic to layout you're coming in the next slide yeah yeah thank you sir"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,A1aWZcz1Krk,to your tape out so the first thing you do is you do a schematic capture because you have an idea that i want to design a nand gate so you say a nand gate i will want to make like this a b a b and these are p masses this you must say is y okay so this is the schematic after you've made the schematic in the schematic capture you will analyze this how will you analyze this you will give different stimuli to a and b and you will see if your output is coming uh correctly or not that is simulation after you have verified that the schematic is working fine you know at least on the schematic level i am getting the the functionality that i wanted the kind of delays that i was targeting i am able to achieve them then you go to the layout you implement this in the form of a layout okay so you will design a few p masses you will design nmoses you will connect them so don't worry you will do all of this i will make you do all of this but yeah okay [Music] so this is the layout once you've made the layout you see that are all the design rule checks now what do you understand by design rules jack anyone uh so this talks about the set of rules that has to be followed in designing a particular layout yeah so look at it like this uh i ask you to draw two parallel lines on a sheet of paper as close to each other as possible without them even touching ever so you do realize that there is some the second line that i draw it went it went a little wavy because i was worried that it should not touch the first line so you do realize that if you have a kind of instrumentation i i did not use a scale but if i use a ruler i can probably draw them much a little bit still closer but then you know if the tip of my pencil is not sharp i will draw them a little farther away so there are so many instrumentation reasons because of which i cannot draw these two lines closer than a minimum spacing because if i try to do that then somewhere there is a possibility they will short with each other are you able to see this so this minimum spacing that we have to keep between any two rectangles that we just made here is called design rules check now these are design rules and we should not be violating any of these design rules otherwise when we fabricate on silicon there could be a loss of functionality somewhere so as you make the layout you also simultaneously do the design rules deck drc we call it drc okay then we do what is called as layout versus schematic check what is layout versus schematic check this check means that see i had this circuit in my mind and uh i am trying to implement a this circuit in a in a layout so i said this is ground this is vdd but it could happen that i have made some connection wrong somewhere so to verify that this layout actually represents the same the schematic that i had intended to draw to implement is called as layout versus schematic text okay so what did we do when we were going down from schematic to layout we would we did a verification what was the verification that i should run my simulation and see that my schematic is operating as it is expected to be and then once we have done the layout we again do a verification that this layout is in the same as representing the same functionality as the schematic wanted to so verification is not just done downwards it is also done backwards this you noticed even in the chip implementation flow last time where we said that once we have the post layout stuff we go back to the uh to the sts data and see that even after the post layout things are still fine you remember that so we do lots of two and four runs to ensure that things are as they were expected to be and this layout versus schematic is one such back and forth run is that okay any questions vaishnav you have a question yes sir so uh sir while uh while we are doing layout uh i mean like uh we can drag it in uh into anywhere like uh giving some space some area or more area so how do we area it's not what i meant exactly uh so uh i mean like we we can do we can do whatever we want uh avoiding the errors right said i'm like there are many possibilities that we come to a conclusion uh so my doubt is that uh how can we say that our model is much efficient so minimum area uh okay so i mean like yes sir would there be any kind of uh uh i mean like any kind of option that we can check our area in the in the uh so no no no that is not available you just draw and then the competition will tell that your area is good or bad suppose you join intel and you draw something or let us say you join synopsis and you make a layout then arm is also working on the same technology or st is also working on the same technology they will also be making their layouts yes some customers will come back to you and tell you your area is bad you don't want to use your library you will go with arm so it's it's like a already too late it's already too late when you get this information the customers are already lost okay so don't wait for that benchmark always strive to make a very dense layout as dense as possible okay yes sir thank you yeah you can lower your hand yeah so once the layout versus schematic thing is done then we do a what is called as a parasitic extraction see till the time we were in the schematic phase did you even talk about the capacitance of this wire a and how this wire a capacitance is coupling with the output no you could make something but usually you would not do you simply say a is an input and y is the output but over here when you make this layout you see that there is an input a coming over here there would be some metal over here which is we're running very close to my output so there is bound to be some capacitance i need to extract that capacitance and see its impact on my results so that is the next step after the lvs is done we go to the step of parasitic extraction so all the parasitic resistances and capacitances can be extracted and okay in this course we will not look into these two aspects okay but we will after parasitic extraction go to post layout circuit analysis those two aspects are valid when we are talking about circuits like ios where package you know what kind of package is being used also comes into picture and uh ios being analog in in their characteristic uh the substrate coupling extractor also becomes big in this course since we are going to work on digital circuits so substrate noise and package model thing do not really bother us in this course okay these are separate independent job profiles the package model extraction and and verification this is a separate job profile in itself we will not be covering it in this course and once you've done the post layout circuit analysis you know check that the delays are in line with my specification even after these extra parasitics have come into picture that is when we say that my circuit is complete i can go ahead for a tape out okay there's a question yes yes sir what do we exactly mean by substrate so substrate coupling is uh let us say i have a processor over here on one side and there's a let us say this is a picture i have a processor over here and let us say there is a pll over here somewhere now since this is the same chip they are sharing the same substrate now if the processor is operating at let us say 2 gigahertz there will be some currents which will flow into the substrate those currents have to be sunk somewhere there is a very high probability that the noise injected by this processor will impact the functionality of this ell so when you are designing that pll you have to see that there is no substrate noise or even if there is a presence of substrate noise your circuit should work well even after that right so it's like you know source to body capacitance and so we're taking account for that uh yes because social body junction capacitance will always exist junctions would toggle so there would be some current in the source and that can lead to noise for the other circuits which could be sensitive to that noise in this course since we are looking at digital circuits only such noise is not really bothersome for us right okay and how do we how do we solve these problems okay so we use uh we use uh things like guard rings so guard rings are uh so if let us say this is your nand gate let us say this is an analog circuit so what i will do is around this analog circuit i will make a ring a ring or substrate connection okay so if there is any noise coming from anywhere else because this ring has all bdd substrate connections and ground substrate connections in it this ring will sync that current it will not let that current spoil the behavior of the transistors enclosed within it okay okay okay there is another technique which we call as deep and well or triple well technology will not look into that just yet but there are many methods as at a designer level if you want to do something you can work with either triple uh triple wells or with guard rings guard rings are more appropriate when you do not want to lose area you know when it is when the circuit when these circuits have to be placed really close together then guard rings are denser right okay but it wasn't the problem you know that uh the current was flowing into the substrate so like uh yeah so how it so the god if the guard ring is also a substrate yeah yeah but it is giving it a power supply now the ring is fully connected to vdds or gnds or whatever is a substrate supply very richly connected so no noise from the analog circuit can go to the digital side nor from the digital circuit come to the analog side because there is such huge sync such good connectivity to substrate power in this gathering yeah okay so we move forward any other questions oh one more you know when we are in the drc uh step we can check the minimum drift and area of the we could check the minimum width and area of the poly and all other things so by that can we not make the area of the layout minimum yes that is the minimum that is the way see uh vaishnava was saying that you have such a big field draw your devices anywhere why will you anyone ever face an error i said yes you will never face an error but then you will lose area so you design minimum area at minimum drc and go ahead okay yes sir so if we get to know about this parasitic capacitances then how will it affect our circuit and how we'll get rid of them oh you tell me if there is an rc in a in a circuit what happens it's extra delay yes so that is how it will affect the circuit your targeted timing but there is a capacitance there so the timing changes to 550 picoseconds yes sir and then how how will resolve this issue we will increase the width of the devices so that this extra capacitance can also be you know handled okay okay thank you yeah and then it was in this is that is that what happens yes so in the post layout circuit analysis all the resistances and capacitances that are parasitically present in your net list would be embedded into the design and then you simulate again so your design would actually have this capacitance there it will have a capacitance from b to output it will have a capacitance from b to this internal node you will have a capacitance from a to this internal node and so on so post layout netlist will have all the capacitances in picture and then we will simulate it it will also have some resistance between ground and and you know your nmos there okay yes there we are good afternoon sir uh basically i want to know what we are exactly doing parasitic extraction i don't get it so do you realize that when you will make the wires to make these connections between a and the gates of the two transistors and so on these wires will have some some capacitance of theirs yeah these wires are metal plates so when there are some capacitance there would you not want to see the impact of that capacitance on circuit behavior so the first step to see their impact on circuit behavior is to measure or estimate the value of this capacitance yeah that is what parasitic extraction step does okay so uh will it create any issue or not type no we do not even know that parasitic extraction step only estimates the various capacitances whether it is creating an issue or not we check that in the post layout circuit analysis okay so so yes yes so the temperature factor is also uh checked in post checks yes has to be um because estimating temperature cannot be is it possible by looking at the previous models so you can say that my circuit has a functional specification to operate fine between 125 degree celsius and minus 40 degree celsius okay so you have the specification you you've taken that specification range okay sir sir am i audible yes akash as you mentioned already so vaishnav already had his hand raised if it's not linked to what akshay just so as you have mentioned we considered the effect of passive capacity extraction in the post layout circuit analysis so after considering if we see that there is some effect then we again go to previous step and consider this effect before typing it out yes then we go back to the circuit state schematic stage we say that i want to increase the size of this particular nmos because the output capacitance is very large the nmr size that i have put yet will not be able to drive sufficient current and give me the timing that i am looking for so i increase the size in the schematic i then change the layout i then change the i then again do drc lvs again extract and then resimulate entire loop has to be done again sir uh yes sir so sir uh when we get to know about the parasitic extraction uh then are we uh connecting these capacitors manually by ourselves in layout again or would there be any kind of option for us to check this parasitic extraction after lvs see in the layout you made those wires already so those parasitics are already there you don't need to do anything else they're already there they're parasitic they're not to be designed they're parasitics they just appear are there parasites parasites okay so uh then uh why don't these uh and i mean like show up in design role check and layout for this schematic uh i mean like uh during those even these parenthesis uh parasitics are present right sir yeah so i mean like the outputs which we get are included with these parasitic extractions or or i mean like are they excluded with this parasitic extension so output of what output of design rule check yes sir no design rule check is a different tool altogether you do design rules check with calibre uh and you do parasitic extraction with a different tool let us say rc extract okay okay sir so after layout uh now if we check the output i'm like in any output for example you have done a cmos inverter over in our refresher so uh after layout uh i mean like if we uh if we take the output so the output would be with respect to paracetamol the output we get would be including the parasitic extractions or unlike the capacitance included it will include if you have done the extraction and embedded the capacitances into your netlist if you're doing the post layout circuit analysis it will include you made the layout left it there and then you're redoing the simulation of the schematic again then no change so sir then i mean we have already got our output so then why are we doing this parasitic extraction again sir uh i'm let we already know uh unlike uh at which time our circuit is getting um work and at which time it's getting turned off so first tell me one thing tell me one thing in the first schematic that you made are you sure how much is the wire capacitance uh no sir i'm not sure but otherwise you cannot put that capacitance or even if you have put that capacitance could be wrong uh but the output which we get would be included of this capacitance that i mean to be able to get that output you have to do a parasitic extraction so how will you estimate the capacitance the layout is simply rectangles yes sir the layout is simply rectangle rectangles don't tell you anything yes sir but output which we get at layout is simply rectangles no it has some rectangles and layout assembly rectangles for supposing we we give this a four called easy wave and we we get to know this way uh waveform analysis so you will go through the entire flow again don't worry so you will see that drc is a separate step and parasitic extraction is a separate step if you do not do parasitic extraction and only do let us say until lvs okay then you will not be able to add these extra capacitances in your net list you will never be able to see the impact of those capacitances on your circuit behavior okay we just want to know the effect of this specifically on the circuit yes okay okay i'm like now i understand i was thinking only about that i was only concerned about the output but not about this exact index effect of key capacity look at it like this without these capacitances the delay could be 500 pico seconds and that could be well within your specification as soon as these capacitances come you need to increase the your delay increases to 550 picoseconds which could be out of your specification so what do you do akash is asking this in the chat window also what do you do i said you increase the size of your nmos and your pmos so that it can now sync more current when you increase the size of your nmos and pmos what does it do it increases the drive capability of these devices so they can now sync or provide more current so that extra current can discharge this extra capacitor also within the stipulated time that is why you will still you will come back within the specifications okay does that solve

circuits have to be placed really close together then guard rings are denser right okay but it wasn't the problem you know that uh the current was flowing into the substrate so like uh yeah so how it so the god if the guard ring is also a substrate yeah yeah but it is giving it a power supply now the ring is fully connected to vdds or gnds or whatever is a substrate supply very richly connected so no noise from the analog circuit can go to the digital side nor from the digital circuit come to the analog side because there is such huge sync such good connectivity to substrate power in this gathering yeah okay so we move forward any other questions oh one more you know when we are in the drc uh step we can check the minimum drift and area of the we could check the minimum width and area of the poly and all other things so by that can we not make the area of the layout minimum yes that is the minimum that is the way see uh vaishnava was saying that you have such a big field draw your devices anywhere why will you anyone ever face an error i said yes you will never face an error but then you will lose area so you design minimum area at minimum drc and go ahead okay yes sir so if we get to know about this parasitic capacitances then how will it affect our circuit and how we'll get rid of them oh you tell me if there is an rc in a in a circuit what happens it's extra delay yes so that is how it will affect the circuit your targeted timing but there is a capacitance there so the timing changes to 550 picoseconds yes sir and then how how will resolve this issue we will increase the width of the devices so that this extra capacitance can also be you know handled okay okay thank you yeah and then it was in this is that is that what happens yes so in the post layout circuit analysis all the resistances and capacitances that are parasitically present in your net list would be embedded into the design and then you simulate again so your design would actually have this capacitance there it will have a capacitance from b to output it will have a capacitance from b to this internal node you will have a capacitance from a to this internal node and so on so post layout netlist will have all the capacitances in picture and then we will simulate it it will also have some resistance between ground and and you know your nmos there okay yes there we are good afternoon sir uh basically i want to know what we are exactly doing parasitic extraction i don't get it so do you realize that when you will make the wires to make these connections between a and the gates of the two transistors and so on these wires will have some some capacitance of theirs yeah these wires are metal plates so when there are some capacitance there would you not want to see the impact of that capacitance on circuit behavior so the first step to see their impact on circuit behavior is to measure or estimate the value of this capacitance yeah that is what parasitic extraction step does okay so uh will it create any issue or not type no we do not even know that parasitic extraction step only estimates the various capacitances whether it is creating an issue or not we check that in the post layout circuit analysis okay so so yes yes so the temperature factor is also uh checked in post checks yes has to be um because estimating temperature cannot be is it possible by looking at the previous models so you can say that my circuit has a functional specification to operate fine between 125 degree celsius and minus 40 degree celsius okay so you have the specification you you've taken that specification range okay sir sir am i audible yes akash as you mentioned already so vaishnav already had his hand raised if it's not linked to what akshay just so as you have mentioned we considered the effect of passive capacity extraction in the post layout circuit analysis so after considering if we see that there is some effect then we again go to previous step and consider this effect before typing it out yes then we go back to the circuit state schematic stage we say that i want to increase the size of this particular nmos because the output capacitance is very large the nmr size that i have put yet will not be able to drive sufficient current and give me the timing that i am looking for so i increase the size in the schematic i then change the layout i then change the i then again do drc lvs again extract and then resimulate entire loop has to be done again sir uh yes sir so sir uh when we get to know about the parasitic extraction uh then are we uh connecting these capacitors manually by ourselves in layout again or would there be any kind of option for us to check this parasitic extraction after lvs see in the layout you made those wires already so those parasitics are already there you don't need to do anything else they're already there they're parasitic they're not to be designed they're parasitics they just appear are there parasites parasites okay so uh then uh why don't these uh and i mean like show up in design role check and layout for this schematic uh i mean like uh during those even these parenthesis uh parasitics are present right sir yeah so i mean like the outputs which we get are included with these parasitic extractions or or i mean like are they excluded with this parasitic extension so output of what output of design rule check yes sir no design rule check is a different tool altogether you do design rules check with calibre uh and you do parasitic extraction with a different tool let us say rc extract okay okay sir so after layout uh now if we check the output i'm like in any output for example you have done a cmos inverter over in our refresher so uh after layout uh i mean like if we uh if we take the output so the output would be with respect to paracetamol the output we get would be including the parasitic extractions or unlike the capacitance included it will include if you have done the extraction and embedded the capacitances into your netlist if you're doing the post layout circuit analysis it will include you made the layout left it there and then you're redoing the simulation of the schematic again then no change so sir then i mean we have already got our output so then why are we doing this parasitic extraction again sir uh i'm let we already know uh unlike uh at which time our circuit is getting um work and at which time it's getting turned off so first tell me one thing tell me one thing in the first schematic that you made are you sure how much is the wire capacitance uh no sir i'm not sure but otherwise you cannot put that capacitance or even if you have put that capacitance could be wrong uh but the output which we get would be included of this capacitance that i mean to be able to get that output you have to do a parasitic extraction so how will you estimate the capacitance the layout is simply rectangles yes sir the layout is simply rectangle rectangles don't tell you anything yes sir but output which we get at layout is simply rectangles no it has some rectangles and layout assembly rectangles for supposing we we give this a four called easy wave and we we get to know this way uh waveform analysis so you will go through the entire flow again don't worry so you will see that drc is a separate step and parasitic extraction is a separate step if you do not do parasitic extraction and only do let us say until lvs okay then you will not be able to add these extra capacitances in your net list you will never be able to see the impact of those capacitances on your circuit behavior okay we just want to know the effect of this specifically on the circuit yes okay okay i'm like now i understand i was thinking only about that i was only concerned about the output but not about this exact index effect of key capacity look at it like this without these capacitances the delay could be 500 pico seconds and that could be well within your specification as soon as these capacitances come you need to increase the your delay increases to 550 picoseconds which could be out of your specification so what do you do akash is asking this in the chat window also what do you do i said you increase the size of your nmos and your pmos so that it can now sync more current when you increase the size of your nmos and pmos what does it do it increases the drive capability of these devices so they can now sync or provide more current so that extra current can discharge this extra capacitor also within the stipulated time that is why you will still you will come back within the specifications okay does that solve your"

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,9EqPTLhEWlY,uh both for b-tech students and m tech students now how many of you have heard about what is called as moore's law who can tell me about moore's law so it tells us about the number of uh transistors the the increment in the number of transistors for three years or something i forgot the exact figure per decade and so it says the number of transistors we will get in certain rupees or dollars will get doubled okay very nice so we're already talking business now money now huh vishal you're saying something yes sir i was i was saying like uh he also said like the transistor or the speed of the computers that we see they will dump the speed will double in every every 18 months which is basically if we increase the transistors you know just synonymous okay at a device level the size of the transfer is getting reduced okay so also the speed and the capability over computers will increase in every couple of years and we will pay less for them also okay so we're talking about money what we are going to pay and everything now this is coming from your side not from my side okay great what else other views on moore's law so is it a law so it's just an observation which we are looking so what was it who was more gordon so what what more observed was and that was way back so moore's law says that [Music] every 18 months the number of transistors you can pack per square centimeter will double what did that mean that means that if i have this particular area in which i have to design my chip my functionality then every 18 months this area can shrink so i have some additional bandwidth to add more circuits there what does that mean that means that i can integrate more functionality onto the same die what does that also mean it also means that if i had do not want to add any more functionality i can reduce the die size and my price would reduce or if i add more functionality then at the same price i am now getting more functionality so i am getting more value either case whether my price reduced or more integration happened moore's law said that user value would increase are you able to see this hello yes sir yeah yeah it's clear okay so then this moore's law just said this much then you guys added other stuff and you assume that also to be moore's law was a law or there was something called dennard scaling that was proposed by dennard who said that uh you can reduce the size of gate and when you reduce the size of gate you should you know also reduce the depth of the source and drain and you should reduce the size of the gate oxide thickness of the gate oxide and he gives these rules to say that if you do all this if you do all this then what happens then you're scaling keyboard say because you're reducing the size so you are coming into the small region the price would reduce but also the performance would improve okay so that is denard scaling that with every shrink in technology so when linked with moore's law it may mean to say that not only will your devices become cheaper they will also perform faster okay and then there is another rule pollux rule which said that as you integrate more and more stuff on your diet okay the performance would improve why would the performance improve because now you do not need to go off check so when you have to access a memory the memory is now already on check you don't need to spend delays of going through an i o and then onto a pcb and then on to another i o and then the memory so your overall delays would decrease when you integrate more and more stuff onto the same die so pollack's rule states that when you integrate more the performance would improve so these three gentlemen paula don and dennard and more they kind of established that there is a virtuous cycle that operates in semiconductor manufacturing due to which you know electronics has really changed the face or the way we are living today so uh you know uh when the first time cell phones came in india which was i think 1994 or something like that the phone was this this big heavy like a brick and every call would cost something like 120 rupees per minute today your phones are tiny teeny tiny even if they're not teeny tiny they're not so because of your choice because you wanted a bigger screen otherwise the capability to have very small feature phones is right there feature phones are very very small when you don't have that bigger screen so uh today uh the call rate for example you know you have unlimited calling for 199 rupees for the entire month forget about per minute call rates just talking about a few paisa where i understand the value of money has only degraded so what was 125 rupees in 1994 today it would be worth something like a thousand rupees or more so instead of paying thousand rupees for a call today you are paying only a few pair per call and that is largely because of this this virtuous loop that has saturn and that has changed the very lift today this is the main reason why vlsi is so hot is it will it continue to remain hot we don't know but yeah it is hot today sir yes so i have a thing to asking they're not scaling sir dennard skilling is saying that when we reduce the features the size of the features of a particular device the performance increases and we also see in con in addition to that that the price is also decreasing is he trying to say that scaling means that you are now making the same die in a smaller area so the price is naturally reducing so but like the similar kind of thing moves i said that you are more simply said the number of transistors per centimeter square very double so he also said about price yes we both talked about price in a way okay so more doesn't didn't specifically told about the sizes of the devices no okay basically like i said you will be able to pack more devices per unit square okay not basically even more he gave the rules he gave the rules on how to be able to pack those devices there so can you just repeat that so he gave the rules by which you could enable that okay so you have to reduce that channel length or the great length okay okay so class modes was simply an observation it was not even a law you call it a law it was simply an observation okay okay so what did moore see moore saw that you know the relative manufacturing cost per component was something like this in 1962 then it reduced in 65 then it reduced in 70 and he saw that the number of components were increasing this was his only observation and based on that observation over time what was seen was that actually the number of devices were doubling so this is a logarithmic line okay so if it appears to be linear over here it means actually things are doubling it's a exponential growth and this is what was evident therefore people thought it is a law it actually is not a law it is it was simply an observation okay and because it was not a law actually we noticed that as we come to let us say so this is i'm not sure if you're able to read this clearly this is 90 nanometer this is 65 nanometer this is 40 nanometer 28 nanometer 20 nanometer and 14 nanometer so we see that until 28 nanometer cost is reducing but then the cost is no longer reducing so in a way something about moore's law has given in why why do you think this has happened due to the power dissipation i mean like this was even mentioned in cmos class so as we pack them together the amount of power dissipated gets increased and by then we have to i mean let we have to compensate this cost to reduce that power if that's if that's right i'm not sure about that but i think that is one aspect but no that's not the real reason this is possible manufacturing cost yeah this is only about manufacturing cost why is it breaking why is it increasing now so i think it's something to do with mark's mask sizing and uh i mean because as you said the cost of technology and um and lithography basically when we reduce that to reduce the sizes even more due to that technology the price increase yeah maybe maybe the mask needing more number of masks or better masks or very fine masks something like that so you're kind of there the overall manufacturing ecosystem is not able to handle finer geometries than 28 nanometers so what happens the total number of masks increase and in fact that is the reason you know uh even uh the international semiconductor association it gave a road map you know of technology shrink like this it said in 2013 that by 2025 you will be at seven seven nanometer node or something like this but in its 2015 report it said no that's that doesn't seem to be possible we'll probably saturate at 10 nanometers because they observed that the scaling or the rules that we wanted to apply are no longer possible okay but then what is this all this talk about seven finfets and five sunsets you must have heard about these technologies if at all people are still talking about these technologies so the fact of the matter is in seventh and fifth technology seven nanometers in fact technology there is no dimension which is equal to seven nanometers no physical dimension equal to that it used to be the case until let us say 32 nanometer or even 45 nanometers that do baby nether at 45 nanometer there it used to be the case that what you draw would actually be the dimension on silicon also okay but in seventh in fact for example there's no physical dimension which is equivalent to 7 nanometers it is called 7th and fit only because it is able to give that 15 to 20 performance gain from the previous designs which we used to call it 10 nanometers 10 nanometers has no physical dimension of 10 nanometers in it and it was called 10 nanometers simply because it gave those kind of gains as you would expect from a technology shrink through various other means by using different materials or whatever but it gave you those kind of gains and therefore you call it 10 nanometers input okay but physically there was nothing 10 nanometer in that technology also so what has happened the reality is that the cost of masks has increased very steeply as you come to finer geometries so what does that do that increases the cost of manufacturing significantly why does this mask set cost increase because you're trying to draw features which are let's say 28 nanometer apart by using a light you know with the wavelength of 193 nanometers because of this you have to do a lot of optics and you need to make additional masks so that diffraction patterns interference and all those are taken care of you need to do a lot of resolution enhancement so that you're able to draw a feature of 28 nanometer with a wavelength of light of 193 nanometer there okay and how to uh how to take care of it excuse me sir yes uh so isn't the cost also increasing because as we reduce the size then the defects also increase so the overall average usable actually the chips that are actually usable and correctly functioning they also decrease like we get 15 percent yield or 30 percent yield at the end so that is also increasing this is that the case really for example if i have this one big wafer let me make a few dies out of it able to see this yes yeah we will see this in a little more detail later when we talk about evie but since you already mentioned it so let me just cover it now so let's say this is the wafer i say there were four defects okay one two three and four these four defects will lead to loss of four dice total number of dies are 1 2 3 3 and 12 and 16. so 4 out of 16 dies are defective e loss is 25 huh now let me say i i reduce the chip size to half now how many dice do i have you see i have six six and then eight then again eight possibly this set of dice would start to work i don't know we could add them or six plus let us 24 30 30 plus 3 33 out of 33 dies now four are failing what is the yield loss 12 percent so when you reduce the die area you actually improve yield for the same defectivity that is one more reason why we say that area is gold in vlsi yes so what isn't uh the number of chips database that are defective also depending on the density because if the transistors are sort of big and sparse then if if you have ensured that your drcs are all clean then you're not expecting an error anyways is it not so what about just particles so dust particles so are independent of what technology or how dense your layout is now dust particles are them are the characteristic of your clean room yes but they don't transfer technology technology if there are four dust particles they remain to be four dust particles only so but the probability that they will actually damage a design will increase if the transistors are placed too close together yeah so essentially what happens is as you scale in technology mother you also change the specifications of your clean room instead of a class 10 clean room you will go to class 1 clean room okay so you spend more in the clean room maintaining a clean room but you would not really want those kind of defects to impact your yields there are other very other detractors anyways but at least dust is not something that you will let to distract your yield excuse me sir yes sir i think what he was trying to say and maybe i have the same doubt sir if we start to reduce the size of our steps or our components then the things that can cause defects are going to increase for example for a large component a dust particle might not be as problematic as for something which is comparable to the size of dust so i think what he was trying to say is we have we're going to have more number of problems as we start to reduce the size of the components and we need to tackle those problems because of which our cost will increase yeah but uh maintaining a clean room uh which is of a higher quality does not increase the cost in the same ratio as the mask set cost that you are seeing here how much yeah and okay so i understand i know that is some logistics yes some costume three is one person two percent not like this so we are just i know we are we are at the end of the time allocated for the class is it okay if we continue for another three four minutes we will just close this section then this is okay so how to reduce this cost mask set cost one way to reduce this mass set cost is by using what is called as photo uh extreme ultraviolet light for photolithography so all these you know uh 1900 i said 1900 dual patterning 1900i second generation dual patterning all these use 193 nanometer light okay what we are saying is that please go to euv uv the wavelength of light is 13 nanometer as soon as you do that the number of masks that you will need will reduce and therefore as you also increase the capability of your euv machines that is they are able to give more power and therefore expose more number of dice per unit unit time you will reduce the cost further so there are but you know there is only one company in the world that makes these euv machines asml and whatever is the semiconductor cycle asml stock price always rises rises and rises you know why because it is the only one no one has yet mastered the same technology the way asml has mastered it so we see that 7th in fact has been made has been enabled largely because euv has come into picture and litho litho costs have been pushed back towards the normal range they're not no longer increasing at the same rate okay but euv is being used only for uh you know a few layers and let us say 15 or 16 and fit but in many layers than when you're talking about seven sensitive technology okay and then another way that the semiconductor industry has found their way uh around more is you know more is like saying that okay go from 130 to 90 to 165 to 45 and so on this is baseline cmos for processing technologies but we realize that because electronics is touching different facets of life we also need analog circuits which would not scale we need high voltage circuits for example those and cars you know car batteries they will not they cannot scale so we are also adding additional content onto our technology so that electronics continues to add more value to users independent of whether the scaling happens miniaturize miniaturization happens or not okay this direction of movement is called more than more this is essentially diversifying so you have image sensors you have capacitive sensors you have all these piezoelectric sensors everything is trying to getting embedded onto the die into the same die integrated into the same die and uh you now adding more dies onto the same package so system and package and so on so overall you are able to add higher value to the users there okay so that is the primary reason why vrsi is hot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EqPTLhEWlY,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EqPTLhEWlY

tiny even if they're not teeny tiny they're not so because of your choice because you wanted a bigger screen otherwise the capability to have very small feature phones is right there feature phones are very very small when you don't have that bigger screen so uh today uh the call rate for example you know you have unlimited calling for 199 rupees for the entire month forget about per minute call rates just talking about a few paisa where i understand the value of money has only degraded so what was 125 rupees in 1994 today it would be worth something like a thousand rupees or more so instead of paying thousand rupees for a call today you are paying only a few pair per call and that is largely because of this this virtuous loop that has saturn and that has changed the very lift today this is the main reason why vlsi is so hot is it will it continue to remain hot we don't know but yeah it is hot today sir yes so i have a thing to asking they're not scaling sir dennard skilling is saying that when we reduce the features the size of the features of a particular device the performance increases and we also see in con in addition to that that the price is also decreasing is he trying to say that scaling means that you are now making the same die in a smaller area so the price is naturally reducing so but like the similar kind of thing moves i said that you are more simply said the number of transistors per centimeter square very double so he also said about price yes we both talked about price in a way okay so more doesn't didn't specifically told about the sizes of the devices no okay basically like i said you will be able to pack more devices per unit square okay not basically even more he gave the rules he gave the rules on how to be able to pack those devices there so can you just repeat that so he gave the rules by which you could enable that okay so you have to reduce that channel length or the great length okay okay so class modes was simply an observation it was not even a law you call it a law it was simply an observation okay okay so what did moore see moore saw that you know the relative manufacturing cost per component was something like this in 1962 then it reduced in 65 then it reduced in 70 and he saw that the number of components were increasing this was his only observation and based on that observation over time what was seen was that actually the number of devices were doubling so this is a logarithmic line okay so if it appears to be linear over here it means actually things are doubling it's a exponential growth and this is what was evident therefore people thought it is a law it actually is not a law it is it was simply an observation okay and because it was not a law actually we noticed that as we come to let us say so this is i'm not sure if you're able to read this clearly this is 90 nanometer this is 65 nanometer this is 40 nanometer 28 nanometer 20 nanometer and 14 nanometer so we see that until 28 nanometer cost is reducing but then the cost is no longer reducing so in a way something about moore's law has given in why why do you think this has happened due to the power dissipation i mean like this was even mentioned in cmos class so as we pack them together the amount of power dissipated gets increased and by then we have to i mean let we have to compensate this cost to reduce that power if that's if that's right i'm not sure about that but i think that is one aspect but no that's not the real reason this is possible manufacturing cost yeah this is only about manufacturing cost why is it breaking why is it increasing now so i think it's something to do with mark's mask sizing and uh i mean because as you said the cost of technology and um and lithography basically when we reduce that to reduce the sizes even more due to that technology the price increase yeah maybe maybe the mask needing more number of masks or better masks or very fine masks something like that so you're kind of there the overall manufacturing ecosystem is not able to handle finer geometries than 28 nanometers so what happens the total number of masks increase and in fact that is the reason you know uh even uh the international semiconductor association it gave a road map you know of technology shrink like this it said in 2013 that by 2025 you will be at seven seven nanometer node or something like this but in its 2015 report it said no that's that doesn't seem to be possible we'll probably saturate at 10 nanometers because they observed that the scaling or the rules that we wanted to apply are no longer possible okay but then what is this all this talk about seven finfets and five sunsets you must have heard about these technologies if at all people are still talking about these technologies so the fact of the matter is in seventh and fifth technology seven nanometers in fact technology there is no dimension which is equal to seven nanometers no physical dimension equal to that it used to be the case until let us say 32 nanometer or even 45 nanometers that do baby nether at 45 nanometer there it used to be the case that what you draw would actually be the dimension on silicon also okay but in seventh in fact for example there's no physical dimension which is equivalent to 7 nanometers it is called 7th and fit only because it is able to give that 15 to 20 performance gain from the previous designs which we used to call it 10 nanometers 10 nanometers has no physical dimension of 10 nanometers in it and it was called 10 nanometers simply because it gave those kind of gains as you would expect from a technology shrink through various other means by using different materials or whatever but it gave you those kind of gains and therefore you call it 10 nanometers input okay but physically there was nothing 10 nanometer in that technology also so what has happened the reality is that the cost of masks has increased very steeply as you come to finer geometries so what does that do that increases the cost of manufacturing significantly why does this mask set cost increase because you're trying to draw features which are let's say 28 nanometer apart by using a light you know with the wavelength of 193 nanometers because of this you have to do a lot of optics and you need to make additional masks so that diffraction patterns interference and all those are taken care of you need to do a lot of resolution enhancement so that you're able to draw a feature of 28 nanometer with a wavelength of light of 193 nanometer there okay and how to uh how to take care of it excuse me sir yes uh so isn't the cost also increasing because as we reduce the size then the defects also increase so the overall average usable actually the chips that are actually usable and correctly functioning they also decrease like we get 15 percent yield or 30 percent yield at the end so that is also increasing this is that the case really for example if i have this one big wafer let me make a few dies out of it able to see this yes yeah we will see this in a little more detail later when we talk about evie but since you already mentioned it so let me just cover it now so let's say this is the wafer i say there were four defects okay one two three and four these four defects will lead to loss of four dice total number of dies are 1 2 3 3 and 12 and 16. so 4 out of 16 dies are defective e loss is 25 huh now let me say i i reduce the chip size to half now how many dice do i have you see i have six six and then eight then again eight possibly this set of dice would start to work i don't know we could add them or six plus let us 24 30 30 plus 3 33 out of 33 dies now four are failing what is the yield loss 12 percent so when you reduce the die area you actually improve yield for the same defectivity that is one more reason why we say that area is gold in vlsi yes so what isn't uh the number of chips database that are defective also depending on the density because if the transistors are sort of big and sparse then if if you have ensured that your drcs are all clean then you're not expecting an error anyways is it not so what about just particles so dust particles so are independent of what technology or how dense your layout is now dust particles are them are the characteristic of your clean room yes but they don't transfer technology technology if there are four dust particles they remain to be four dust particles only so but the probability that they will actually damage a design will increase if the transistors are placed too close together yeah so essentially what happens is as you scale in technology mother you also change the specifications of your clean room instead of a class 10 clean room you will go to class 1 clean room okay so you spend more in the clean room maintaining a clean room but you would not really want those kind of defects to impact your yields there are other very other detractors anyways but at least dust is not something that you will let to distract your yield excuse me sir yes sir i think what he was trying to say and maybe i have the same doubt sir if we start to reduce the size of our steps or our components then the things that can cause defects are going to increase for example for a large component a dust particle might not be as problematic as for something which is comparable to the size of dust so i think what he was trying to say is we have we're going to have more number of problems as we start to reduce the size of the components and we need to tackle those problems because of which our cost will increase yeah but uh maintaining a clean room uh which is of a higher quality does not increase the cost in the same ratio as the mask set cost that you are seeing here how much yeah and okay so i understand i know that is some logistics yes some costume three is one person two percent not like this so we are just i know we are we are at the end of the time allocated for the class is it okay if we continue for another three four minutes we will just close this section then this is okay so how to reduce this cost mask set cost one way to reduce this mass set cost is by using what is called as photo uh extreme ultraviolet light for photolithography so all these you know uh 1900 i said 1900 dual patterning 1900i second generation dual patterning all these use 193 nanometer light okay what we are saying is that please go to euv uv the wavelength of light is 13 nanometer as soon as you do that the number of masks that you will need will reduce and therefore as you also increase the capability of your euv machines that is they are able to give more power and therefore expose more number of dice per unit unit time you will reduce the cost further so there are but you know there is only one company in the world that makes these euv machines asml and whatever is the semiconductor cycle asml stock price always rises rises and rises you know why because it is the only one no one has yet mastered the same technology the way asml has mastered it so we see that 7th in fact has been made has been enabled largely because euv has come into picture and litho litho costs have been pushed back towards the normal range they're not no longer increasing at the same rate okay but euv is being used only for uh you know a few layers and let us say 15 or 16 and fit but in many layers than when you're talking about seven sensitive technology okay and then another way that the semiconductor industry has found their way uh around more is you know more is like saying that okay go from 130 to 90 to 165 to 45 and so on this is baseline cmos for processing technologies but we realize that because electronics is touching different facets of life we also need analog circuits which would not scale we need high voltage circuits for example those and cars you know car batteries they will not they cannot scale so we are also adding additional content onto our technology so that electronics continues to add more value to users independent of whether the scaling happens miniaturize miniaturization happens or not okay this direction of movement is called more than more this is essentially diversifying so you have image sensors you have capacitive sensors you have all these piezoelectric sensors everything is trying to getting embedded onto the die into the same die integrated into the same die and uh you now adding more dies onto the same package so system and package and so on so overall you are able to add higher value to the users there okay so that is the primary reason why vrsi is hot"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,1CjvgmPJq1I,so uh why is silicon any ideas so because we first of all we get the in the particular band gap we get the right cap bind gap thing and it's a group for uh we have the four valence electrons and we cannot have carbon because that becomes too tightly bonded so here we get the kind of properties that at a temperature higher than zero kelvin we get the semiconductor properties so and it's also really easily available sand it's there so that is also there okay other ideas small leakage current and high temperature applications uh the virus small leakage current and high temperature applications and high temperature applications they will be better with germanium actually but small leakage current is more in germany okay they're abundantly available silicon and it can be partially dropped or negative so that it can be partially dropped or negatively doped so that we can get an extensive entrance sorry we i'm like we can get a posture on it it's an extrinsic i'm like if you do that with something it's an extrinsic so yeah that's it okay it's closely available right cpu available okay somewhere also something uh it is non-toxic it is non-toxic it is non-toxic okay compared to other groups okay comfortable with the wide range of temperature wide range of temperature okay can be purified in comparison to germanium germanium okay but what about silicon carbide why not silicon carbide silicon carbide can handle much more power voltage [Music] [Music] okay so all of us know so many properties of silicon why are these properties of silicon so evident there what is it that gives silicon its properties like that uh the atomic structure of silicon crystalline structure the crystalline structure of silicon yes great so uh when we talk of crystalline structure what is the crystal so uh basically we can say that repetitive arrangement of atoms when the atoms of a material are arranged in a repetitive manner for a very long distance we call it as a crystal otherwise there will be some arrangement of atoms which could change every every now and then so we call it polycrystalline or amorphous but whenever when there is a systematic arrangement of atoms for a long range we call that as crystalline in fact in one crystal it is only one arrangement of atoms as soon as that arrangement of atom changes we call it as a second crystal so the most common crystalline structure that we know of is you know simple cubic so repetitive arrangement of atoms and there are different kinds of ones uh simple cubic body centered face centered we'll just look at them and then we understand that as you change the type of crystal structure the various features like density physical properties chemical properties and even electrical properties of materials change diamond has very different chemical properties and electrical properties than graphite both are pure carbon and that difference is largely because of different structure of the crystal am i right different arrangement of atoms in the two materials and the properties are entirely different even though the chemical component which composition is same so crystalline structure has or the crystal structure has significant bearing on say physical and electrical properties and that is what we are interested in as of now okay so this is face centered cubic structure where you have the atoms at the boundary of or at the edges at the vertices of the cuboid but you also have atoms at the faces okay this is face centered cubic and this is diamond cubic so what has happened over here in a diamond cubic structure what you've done is in addition to these atoms at the center of the faces you also add atoms in four of the internal eight uh short cubes small cubes so you have atoms inside uh different uh small cubes you know in total there will be eight small cubes inside out of those eight small cubes there are atoms in four of them and they are organized like this i believe all of you must have studied this in your semiconductor physics in 11th and 12th if not later anyone who has not studied it please put a minus one in your chat window i believe all of us must have seen this in our 11th 12th or even later than that okay so this is diamond cubic structure and let us look at a short animation of how this diamond cubic structure looks like from from different perspectives okay so this isn't you know we're just rotating a diamond cubic crystal and you notice that when i try to see at different angles i would see different density and uh and therefore different physical properties will appear so what all will change let us say i want to send an electron from one side to the other and there is this large density of atoms there electron will experience lots of resistance to pass whereas when you have that hexagonal view there like this one you will see that electrons will pass easily so the direction in which i am trying to move my current the electrical properties will also vary the physical properties will also vary depending on what is happening okay so what is happening is that in different planes in different planes there is a different density of atoms and even different topology of atoms therefore they have different electrical properties and therefore it is very important that when we design or when we fabricate any device we should fabricate it very carefully in the desired plane are you able to see this challenge so we we can easily make silicon crystal so have you done some experiments with crystallizing say alum or sugar or something in your school school times make a solution of sugar and crystallize it you done such kind of experiments in school days yes sir huh so can you ascertain that this is the plane in which all the crystals are formed when you do a regular such experiment are you able to ascertain that no no so what we are saying is that when we want to make silicon crystals for fabrication purpose uh because the properties of the crystal electrical properties of the crystal are different across different planes and i have all my models and all my process assumptions based on one kind of plane so i rather would have my electrons flowing in that direction are you able to see this point that the crystalline plane has to be the the plane in which you will fabricate your devices has to be carefully chosen so the crystal has to be carefully manufactured it cannot be just like the home experiments on crystallizing of sugar that you did are you able to see this any questions around this topic sir yes nish uh sir uh so you are saying that uh in that previous 3d diagram of diamond uh say foreign so yes if you change the direction of electron flow it will see different kind of resistivity okay there has to be some more you know process that should go in is it not is crystallizing or using even though sand is abundantly available you cannot make a silicon wafer at home just like you could make a sugar crystal at home you cannot do the same for silicon wafers is this finger is this thing clear yes so then we because if this thing is clear we can then move to the next step of how this wafer is fabricated so uh the complexity of vlsi design or vsf fabrication starts from the very base of how to manufacture this crystal which has the same direction and the same plane as we wanted to be okay so uh what is done is we use a silicon crystal and we dip it in molten silicon and this silicon crystal that we have we put it so carefully into our uh uh into our uh instrument so that it when it goes the dips into the molten crystal it then starts to crystallize you know it solidifies according to the crystals orientation so the orientation of my seed crystal is carefully chosen and determined and only then you dip it into there okay and then you slowly pull out this crystal from from this molten mass and the speed with which you pull it out so you rotate it and you pull it out the speed with which you pull it out will define the width of this in got so this is called as in got okay and based on this you will be able to make 6 inches 8 inches or 12 inch wafers 12 inch wafer is this big diametrically okay so i can actually literally hide my face behind the 12 inch even 8 inch wafer it can fairly hide my face don't probably not my hair but a 12 inch will hide everything of my face and here okay so this this big wafers uh coming out of it and can you imagine the weight of this whole ingot as it would pull it out and a 12 inch wafer you know so it's huge so this process is called so so we did this this is a this is a of vacant phrase so to choose falci process okay so uh this is how ingots are made once the ingots are made do you see that this ingot has a lot of these uh you know contours on its surface are you able to see this so what this means is that the sim card cannot be used directly to make wafers because then some wafers will be 12 inch uh 12 inch wide or 12 inch diameter some would be 12.1 others would be 12.2 and so on but all your machines are designed for a see we need nanometer level accuracy in our machines so the machines are designed such that they 112 inch wafer so you cannot really handle 12.1 inch also and 12.2 inch also and then say oh i will give you the accuracy of nanometers when i expose the or when i make your wafers or when i make your silicon dies so here it says the process has to be you know some something needs to be done so that each wafer is exactly okay so since i forget the formula sorry because we just put in one crystal and as we are pulling it out from that molten material the silicon atoms would align to align to the existing crystalline structure so there would there would be just one crystal there i don't get it yeah so then this is not an ic of course you will need to probably read a little more of it off the course but yeah this is the way you tip a crystal there and all now because this is the property of the material that atoms will bond with other atoms in the orientation of the existing crystal okay yeah okay and then when you slowly pull it out those atoms are now a part of that earlier crystal so they become a bigger crystal okay and then as you pull it out it becomes a still bigger crystal a still bigger question and until you reach that width until you reach that width of let us say 12.5 inches you you just pull it out very very slowly you slowly you know you you pull it out and then you say that okay now at a stable speed i will pull it out so that all the crystals are at that 12 inch approximately 12 12.5 inch wide uh wafer there okay so for dedicated machine that it is like forming okay if you want to relate to that i will not but yeah it's okay whatever helps you on your understanding rather uh sir like for example you said that we are not only interested in manufacturing the silicon crystal but a particular orientation so so like we put the crystal in a particular orientation and we pulled it out so but still for example we are getting the whole crystal and if you are getting the crystal all the particular orientations are still possible so we need to then have to be in direction also okay this is the from where can i get the orientation like because i cannot access that so when you are seeding at that point of time the orientation is established with the help of a microscope so but still i'm getting the crystal right so in crystal every orientation is possible yeah yeah that is okay if you make if you have a crystal with this kind of a plane then it will it will grow like this only whichever plane you choose that is how it will grow that is the property of a crystal okay so i have chosen the plane also okay this is the plane okay yeah okay sir ingot is something that holds the silicon crystals and what is that huge mass of uh silicon circular mass of silicon which through which you will slice and get the crystals okay sir okay that is what we are on and looking at going to look at in this slide so you first get that n got and then you slice it to make crystals or to make wafers these wafers then you grind so that they are all circular because you we just saw that they may not be all circular at all times so then the grinding is done so that you get circular wafers of exactly 12 inch diameter or or eight inch diameter or six inch diameter whichever your machining is ready for okay and then because you slice these crystals so you've tried to cut let us say slices of cucumber or tomato at home for making salad yes sir can you always cut them in the same of the same width no sir so it can happen that some wafers are thicker some are not as thick but again realize that our machining is such that it can it has to make things which are accurate to the level of nanometers so you cannot really have different thickness of wafers otherwise the light that will fall from the top will not fall at the side right angle okay sir uh this is the reason why amalek will get the wafer in a circular shape i'm like we are dipping it out and the way it spreads it will be a circle i'm like one of the person so we this this was a question in the last class i have to why don't you make it square now if i have to make it square i have to cut some part of the circular wafer which actually leads to more loss of you know if in a circular wafer you will probably be able to get more dice than a square which has a smaller size than it so in lapping in the second step that you do wrapping you actually make the thickness of the wafers exactly let us say five millimeter or uh two millimeters or whatever is the agreed specification for that particular wafer okay then you do the polishing because all this grinding and lapping there could be some broken bonds on the on the and dislocations that you may have introduced on the surface of the wafer so do the polishing and then you dope it the the substrate is typically p type doped and uh and you then create a flat so you dope the you do you dope uh boron into it let us say so it is p type and uh then what you do the circular wafer you create a flat over here a little flat when you have an n type then you also create a secondary flap so this flap would be let us say uh four centimeters this flat would be something like two centimeter i don't know the exact numbers you can find out on the internet if you are interested but in an entire wafer you will have two flats in a p-type wafer you have one plant okay in advanced technologies or today you do not even talk of flat you talk of what is called as a notch and uh that notch defines that this like this is the notch so if my current flows in this particular direction i will be using one one one kind of direction so the notch not only defines uh that this is an n type or a p type but it also tells where is the one one one plane or one one zero direction so to say in that particular wafer because the current flow uh the electrical properties in different directions are different so we also need to tell the user that this is where this is how you should fabricate it this is how you should place the wafer in your fabrication machinery okay any questions still here so uh in the in god which we are making will it have like uniform diameter throughout no that is why we need to do grinding ah okay sir so like how can we know like what is the diameter of the ingot that is formed and can we know it before uh creating the angle yeah like you know the cooling rate you you can control the temperature of your furnace you can do everything so that you can estimate you know this this is a physical model you can which actually can be easily made and it is existing so the speed at which you are pulling the wafer out and everything and the site can easily be used to decide the size of the ingot okay it's a physical process the purely physical process will characterize physical process oh sir you said that when we were pulling out the in god we were pulling out in the direction uh which was corresponding to the orientation which we wanted right so like now what exactly we are doing this is flat because because we know that okay like this is the orientation i got so that is the plane we are saying this is the plane but in a plane also for example if we look at the plane a face centered cubic plane so if i go in this direction there will be one kind of resistance if i go in this direction there will be another kind of resistance are you able to see this yes sir so i need to tell which direction to go because that is where all my models and all my everything is designed for okay okay so at the ingot level i have only got the plane orientation but now the direction you get lanes now this is only a big plane that you know now you need to know the direction also so that you can actually then fabricate your gates in the right orient right direction within that plane yes okay okay so okay okay you also wanted to ask something deepak suddenly yes sir so sir we are making this notch so some amount of silicon would be wasted right yeah we make that is why we don't know we now don't make a flat you make a notch notch is a small thing flat would have really taken a lot of silicon off but notch is a small thing we don't want to wear silicon wafer area can't you make a mark or something why cut silicon so this notch is also very small if you make a mark you will have to physically you know visually see it and align it a notch is easy because mechanically you can just lock your wafers into the notch when you are transferring wafers from one machine to another a physical asymmetry is always easier to handle in the manufacturing processes than a planar visual asymmetry because then you will need to have cameras and lasers and do everything to align the wafer every time with a notch you just need to get the wafer in and you know the notch is already established and fixed in there so the wafer is properly aligned right so when we are talking about the orientation of a crystal like the crystal is a spherical kind we look at crystalline structures in cuboid from cubic and uh space center we are talking about their orientations and okay okay is everyone comfortable with hindi language is asking something in hindi is everyone comfortable with that anyone who does not understand hindi in this class can you put a plus one in the chat window oh so everyone is comfortable with hindi oh there is deja who is not okay so no issues so actually uh uh currently we have designed a vapor so uh we have prepared a substrate now okay so we have doped and we have built up right now uh what we will do we just build upgrades our source and drain forward uh that the thing is completely perpendicular to the surface so now the current would flow from the top of the gate or from the top of the source of transistor exactly the current flow uh inside the substrate would completely uh would be decided by this uh flat what we are preparing what or it could random direction randomly so if you know that this is the 1 1 direction and you want to orient or you want to have the current flow in in a particular direction you can make uh devices like that such that uh the current will flow in your desired direction you know one direction this is the so you've given you've been given a reference now see consider it like this uh you go to a uh amusement park and you get a map on how to navigate in this amusement park what is the most important thing that you need to look at where are you you are here that that mark okay i am here now in this context i can go left right wherever but that you are here is most important is it not yes so this knot is the you are here mark okay okay yes you said when we are saying that i want to i want to make the current run in only single direction so does that mean i cannot make a mosfet on layout which is in another orientation if i rotate it by 90 so if you do then there could be some consequences which may not be acceptable to you you will see we will just have a look at what happens when you rotate the wafer there's a slide on that don't worry,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CjvgmPJq1I,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CjvgmPJq1I
Transcript: so uh why is silicon any ideas so because we first of all we get the in the particular band gap we get the right cap bind gap thing and it's a group for uh we have the four valence electrons and we cannot have carbon because that becomes too tightly bonded so here we get the kind of properties that at a temperature higher than zero kelvin we get the semiconductor properties so and it's also really easily available sand it's there so that is also there okay other ideas small leakage current and high temperature applications uh the virus small leakage current and high temperature applications and high temperature applications they will be better with germanium actually but small leakage current is more in germany okay they're abundantly available silicon and it can be partially dropped or negative so that it can be partially dropped or negatively doped so that we can get an extensive entrance sorry we i'm like we can get a posture on it it's an extrinsic i'm like if you do that with something it's an extrinsic so yeah that's it okay it's closely available right cpu available okay somewhere also something uh it is non-toxic it is non-toxic it is non-toxic okay compared to other groups okay comfortable with the wide range of temperature wide range of temperature okay can be purified in comparison to germanium germanium okay but what about silicon carbide why not silicon carbide silicon carbide can handle much more power voltage [Music] [Music] okay so all of us know so many properties of silicon why are these properties of silicon so evident

experience lots of resistance to pass whereas when you have that hexagonal view there like this one you will see that electrons will pass easily so the direction in which i am trying to move my current the electrical properties will also vary the physical properties will also vary depending on what is happening okay so what is happening is that in different planes in different planes there is a different density of atoms and even different topology of atoms therefore they have different electrical properties and therefore it is very important that when we design or when we fabricate any device we should fabricate it very carefully in the desired plane are you able to see this challenge so we we can easily make silicon crystal so have you done some experiments with crystallizing say alum or sugar or something in your school school times make a solution of sugar and crystallize it you done such kind of experiments in school days yes sir huh so can you ascertain that this is the plane in which all the crystals are formed when you do a regular such experiment are you able to ascertain that no no so what we are saying is that when we want to make silicon crystals for fabrication purpose uh because the properties of the crystal electrical properties of the crystal are different across different planes and i have all my models and all my process assumptions based on one kind of plane so i rather would have my electrons flowing in that direction are you able to see this point that the crystalline plane has to be the the plane in which you will fabricate your devices has to be carefully chosen so the crystal has to be carefully manufactured it cannot be just like the home experiments on crystallizing of sugar that you did are you able to see this any questions around this topic sir yes nish uh sir uh so you are saying that uh in that previous 3d diagram of diamond uh say foreign so yes if you change the direction of electron flow it will see different kind of resistivity okay there has to be some more you know process that should go in is it not is crystallizing or using even though sand is abundantly available you cannot make a silicon wafer at home just like you could make a sugar crystal at home you cannot do the same for silicon wafers is this finger is this thing clear yes so then we because if this thing is clear we can then move to the next step of how this wafer is fabricated so uh the complexity of vlsi design or vsf fabrication starts from the very base of how to manufacture this crystal which has the same direction and the same plane as we wanted to be okay so uh what is done is we use a silicon crystal and we dip it in molten silicon and this silicon crystal that we have we put it so carefully into our uh uh into our uh instrument so that it when it goes the dips into the molten crystal it then starts to crystallize you know it solidifies according to the crystals orientation so the orientation of my seed crystal is carefully chosen and determined and only then you dip it into there okay and then you slowly pull out this crystal from from this molten mass and the speed with which you pull it out so you rotate it and you pull it out the speed with which you pull it out will define the width of this in got so this is called as in got okay and based on this you will be able to make 6 inches 8 inches or 12 inch wafers 12 inch wafer is this big diametrically okay so i can actually literally hide my face behind the 12 inch even 8 inch wafer it can fairly hide my face don't probably not my hair but a 12 inch will hide everything of my face and here okay so this this big wafers uh coming out of it and can you imagine the weight of this whole ingot as it would pull it out and a 12 inch wafer you know so it's huge so this process is called so so we did this this is a this is a of vacant phrase so to choose falci process okay so uh this is how ingots are made once the ingots are made do you see that this ingot has a lot of these uh you know contours on its surface are you able to see this so what this means is that the sim card cannot be used directly to make wafers because then some wafers will be 12 inch uh 12 inch wide or 12 inch diameter some would be 12.1 others would be 12.2 and so on but all your machines are designed for a see we need nanometer level accuracy in our machines so the machines are designed such that they 112 inch wafer so you cannot really handle 12.1 inch also and 12.2 inch also and then say oh i will give you the accuracy of nanometers when i expose the or when i make your wafers or when i make your silicon dies so here it says the process has to be you know some something needs to be done so that each wafer is exactly okay so since i forget the formula sorry because we just put in one crystal and as we are pulling it out from that molten material the silicon atoms would align to align to the existing crystalline structure so there would there would be just one crystal there i don't get it yeah so then this is not an ic of course you will need to probably read a little more of it off the course but yeah this is the way you tip a crystal there and all now because this is the property of the material that atoms will bond with other atoms in the orientation of the existing crystal okay yeah okay and then when you slowly pull it out those atoms are now a part of that earlier crystal so they become a bigger crystal okay and then as you pull it out it becomes a still bigger crystal a still bigger question and until you reach that width until you reach that width of let us say 12.5 inches you you just pull it out very very slowly you slowly you know you you pull it out and then you say that okay now at a stable speed i will pull it out so that all the crystals are at that 12 inch approximately 12 12.5 inch wide uh wafer there okay so for dedicated machine that it is like forming okay if you want to relate to that i will not but yeah it's okay whatever helps you on your understanding rather uh sir like for example you said that we are not only interested in manufacturing the silicon crystal but a particular orientation so so like we put the crystal in a particular orientation and we pulled it out so but still for example we are getting the whole crystal and if you are getting the crystal all the particular orientations are still possible so we need to then have to be in direction also okay this is the from where can i get the orientation like because i cannot access that so when you are seeding at that point of time the orientation is established with the help of a microscope so but still i'm getting the crystal right so in crystal every orientation is possible yeah yeah that is okay if you make if you have a crystal with this kind of a plane then it will it will grow like this only whichever plane you choose that is how it will grow that is the property of a crystal okay so i have chosen the plane also okay this is the plane okay yeah okay sir ingot is something that holds the silicon crystals and what is that huge mass of uh silicon circular mass of silicon which through which you will slice and get the crystals okay sir okay that is what we are on and looking at going to look at in this slide so you first get that n got and then you slice it to make crystals or to make wafers these wafers then you grind so that they are all circular because you we just saw that they may not be all circular at all times so then the grinding is done so that you get circular wafers of exactly 12 inch diameter or or eight inch diameter or six inch diameter whichever your machining is ready for okay and then because you slice these crystals so you've tried to cut let us say slices of cucumber or tomato at home for making salad yes sir can you always cut them in the same of the same width no sir so it can happen that some wafers are thicker some are not as thick but again realize that our machining is such that it can it has to make things which are accurate to the level of nanometers so you cannot really have different thickness of wafers otherwise the light that will fall from the top will not fall at the side right angle okay sir uh this is the reason why amalek will get the wafer in a circular shape i'm like we are dipping it out and the way it spreads it will be a circle i'm like one of the person so we this this was a question in the last class i have to why don't you make it square now if i have to make it square i have to cut some part of the circular wafer which actually leads to more loss of you know if in a circular wafer you will probably be able to get more dice than a square which has a smaller size than it so in lapping in the second step that you do wrapping you actually make the thickness of the wafers exactly let us say five millimeter or uh two millimeters or whatever is the agreed specification for that particular wafer okay then you do the polishing because all this grinding and lapping there could be some broken bonds on the on the and dislocations that you may have introduced on the surface of the wafer so do the polishing and then you dope it the the substrate is typically p type doped and uh and you then create a flat so you dope the you do you dope uh boron into it let us say so it is p type and uh then what you do the circular wafer you create a flat over here a little flat when you have an n type then you also create a secondary flap so this flap would be let us say uh four centimeters this flat would be something like two centimeter i don't know the exact numbers you can find out on the internet if you are interested but in an entire wafer you will have two flats in a p-type wafer you have one plant okay in advanced technologies or today you do not even talk of flat you talk of what is called as a notch and uh that notch defines that this like this is the notch so if my current flows in this particular direction i will be using one one one kind of direction so the notch not only defines uh that this is an n type or a p type but it also tells where is the one one one plane or one one zero direction so to say in that particular wafer because the current flow uh the electrical properties in different directions are different so we also need to tell the user that this is where this is how you should fabricate it this is how you should place the wafer in your fabrication machinery okay any questions still here so uh in the in god which we are making will it have like uniform diameter throughout no that is why we need to do grinding ah okay sir so like how can we know like what is the diameter of the ingot that is formed and can we know it before uh creating the angle yeah like you know the cooling rate you you can control the temperature of your furnace you can do everything so that you can estimate you know this this is a physical model you can which actually can be easily made and it is existing so the speed at which you are pulling the wafer out and everything and the site can easily be used to decide the size of the ingot okay it's a physical process the purely physical process will characterize physical process oh sir you said that when we were pulling out the in god we were pulling out in the direction uh which was corresponding to the orientation which we wanted right so like now what exactly we are doing this is flat because because we know that okay like this is the orientation i got so that is the plane we are saying this is the plane but in a plane also for example if we look at the plane a face centered cubic plane so if i go in this direction there will be one kind of resistance if i go in this direction there will be another kind of resistance are you able to see this yes sir so i need to tell which direction to go because that is where all my models and all my everything is designed for okay okay so at the ingot level i have only got the plane orientation but now the direction you get lanes now this is only a big plane that you know now you need to know the direction also so that you can actually then fabricate your gates in the right orient right direction within that plane yes okay okay so okay okay you also wanted to ask something deepak suddenly yes sir so sir we are making this notch so some amount of silicon would be wasted right yeah we make that is why we don't know we now don't make a flat you make a notch notch is a small thing flat would have really taken a lot of silicon off but notch is a small thing we don't want to wear silicon wafer area can't you make a mark or something why cut silicon so this notch is also very small if you make a mark you will have to physically you know visually see it and align it a notch is easy because mechanically you can just lock your wafers into the notch when you are transferring wafers from one machine to another a physical asymmetry is always easier to handle in the manufacturing processes than a planar visual asymmetry because then you will need to have cameras and lasers and do everything to align the wafer every time with a notch you just need to get the wafer in and you know the notch is already established and fixed in there so the wafer is properly aligned right so when we are talking about the orientation of a crystal like the crystal is a spherical kind we look at crystalline structures in cuboid from cubic and uh space center we are talking about their orientations and okay okay is everyone comfortable with hindi language is asking something in hindi is everyone comfortable with that anyone who does not understand hindi in this class can you put a plus one in the chat window oh so everyone is comfortable with hindi oh there is deja who is not okay so no issues so actually uh uh currently we have designed a vapor so uh we have prepared a substrate now okay so we have doped and we have built up right now uh what we will do we just build upgrades our source and drain forward uh that the thing is completely perpendicular to the surface so now the current would flow from the top of the gate or from the top of the source of transistor exactly the current flow uh inside the substrate would completely uh would be decided by this uh flat what we are preparing what or it could random direction randomly so if you know that this is the 1 1 direction and you want to orient or you want to have the current flow in in a particular direction you can make uh devices like that such that uh the current will flow in your desired direction you know one direction this is the so you've given you've been given a reference now see consider it like this uh you go to a uh amusement park and you get a map on how to navigate in this amusement park what is the most important thing that you need to look at where are you you are here that that mark okay i am here now in this context i can go left right wherever but that you are here is most important is it not yes so this knot is the you are here mark okay okay yes you said when we are saying that i want to i want to make the current run in only single direction so does that mean i cannot make a mosfet on layout which is in another orientation if i rotate it by 90 so if you do then there could be some consequences which may not be acceptable to you you will see we will just have a look at what happens when you rotate the wafer there's a slide on that don't worry"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,jh6qhtM88KM,so this is the next slide so if you rotate the wafer what happens so until I would say uh 2002 2004 2006 so this is this is February 20 2006 look at this huh so until this time uh Wafers were made in this kind of a format one one zero so it says that your current would flow in one one zero Direction okay but uh Thomas Scott Nikki hmm proposed in 2006. to rotate the substrate such that current would flow in one zero zero Direction now why was this required or and what how did it help so the fact is that in Silicon there are uh two kinds of holes some are light holes so light holes means that the gradation of change of your electric electrostatic field is is sharp and some are heavy holes so if you look into this direction or you know this this hole if you look into this plane this hole would be a heavy hole so in the standard Wafers there were light holes and also heavy holes because uh there was a direction of movement which considered this bad slope and also the so this was symmetrical it's escalated whole whole Mobility was not changing but for this the whole Mobility was changing if you would move in One Direction or the other but when you rotated the wafer what happened when you rotated the wave so you came to this you came to this part of the wafer where this extra lobe was not not a part of your current flow and therefore rotated Wafers also had light holes only so overall mobility of the of the holes improved what does improved whole whole mobility mean that now to get the same current I can have a smaller device so the p2n ratio which was traditionally kept to be something like uh between 2.5 and 3 from this technology onwards which was I think 65 or yeah 65 onwards whole Mobility was significantly improved and you could have P by and ratio closer to two whole Mobility was still worse than electron Mobility but it significantly improved just because you rotated the wafer okay and there was actually no change in electron Mobility because for electrons whether the Wafers are rotated or not the effective weight was same so vulnerability to improved electromobility remains same no degradation on the electron mobility and you've got a win-win kind of a solution you could say more area okay sir that is the importance of understanding what the notch means and how to use the notch yes slither because of the mobility the effective mass is changing or because of the effective mass of Mobility because of the effective Mass Mobility is changing okay okay Mobility is a behavior which depends on the mass a heavier substance would move slower yes sir understood yeah okay so once the wafer is ready you know that I have to use rotated substrate and everything then you go into the manufacturing phase and interestingly in Silicon manufacturing there are a few steps which are just repeated over and over again these are implantation oxidation and deposition so implantation is in fact a front-end process and deposition is then subsequently a backend process so what are we saying that you will make layers of so this is my silicon wafer let us say yeah so you will first implant something onto it after you've implanted you will make a layer of oxide okay then you will deposit something on it which which you would call as a photoresist and then you will remove this photoresist in a patterned manner okay so you will remove it from here let us say so over here you have created a window such that this oxide becomes now visible to incident light so when the light will come it will now be able to fall here but not fall here okay stuff like that so pattern removal and then again implementation implantation or patent removal or oxidation or the position of some of these steps would come you just repeat these over and over again and you're finally able to build your silicon die consider it like this if I have to make a 20 storage building what do I need to do let us let us assume that you have come to the ground level now so what do I need to do I need to make pillars I need to make the walls I need to make the roof for the next level I again need to grow the pillars more I need to make the balls I need to make the roof or whatever pillars roof wall pillars roof wall filler's roof wall and I can go to as many stories as I want to in a similar manner the Silicon manufacturing process also use this the same steps to overall build the wafer over and over again to make multiple layers of metals and so on ticket so this is a primer and this is an example in fact Let us look at an example over here we had a silicon substrate we drew oxide on it or we deposited oxide on it then we deposited photoresist on it then we expose this photoresist they expose this photoresist to a glass mask so you see over here there is a black black line there so light will not pass but over here the glass is transparent so light would pass and this part of the photoresist would get exposed to this light now this photoresist it why is it called a photoresist because it is sensitive to photons it is sensitive to light its chemical properties would change when light falls on it so then you clean this wafer which was already exposed with a acid let us say hydrofluoric acid address and this this part which was exposed that would go away now what you do after this part goes away now what you do you etch h means you remove whatever is available uh visible from the top now so this photoresist is hardened it cannot be etched but the remaining oxide which you had deposited in this phase it will be etched so now you have this kind of a structure in there what will you do now you will remove the photoresist and you will let us say implant boron what would happen Boron would not go beneath this oxide layer but over here you will form a p plus region huh are you able to see this then when you need to make the next layer all that you need to do is again deposit oxide so your gain deposit oxide you again put a photoresist you again expose now a different part and uh so after that after you expose that part then something can be deposited over here in this region okay we will look at it in a little more we will exemplify it a little more in a few minutes but what is essentially happening is that you have a light source and a condenser so we are talking about Optics now so condenser would what does our collimator do condenser do it makes all the rays of light parallel so what happens then this is this is exposed to a mask where there are Parts which are blacked out so that light cannot pass through it and then after the mask there is a projection lens which will again refocus these parallel lights into converging lights and you will be able to expose underlying silicon wafer so this is Wafer already written there you will expose the underlying silicon wafer with light okay so as I mentioned 190c nanometer light has been used for all these technos even in someone people even tried 16 nanometer with 193 nanometer light it does not very so there is lots of diffraction lots of things that come into picture but people have even manufactured 16 nanometer chips with uh 192 nanometer light so what they need to do is to manage the diffraction path they need to say that okay uh if you want to make this kind of a poly you make slits in The Mask you make dummy Pollies around it for this distance so that after diffraction I am able to achieve this poly shape accurately so there are rules that are design rules that are added to be able to enable use of 196 nanometers even at Advanced Technologies There Are Rules which say that two polies uh if they are this close let us say then they will be made on two masks so this will be mask a and this will be mask B so this is called dual patterning why two masks because they cannot really be drawn this close with the 192 nanometer light there there will be diffraction and the one of the gates would die out so you say okay I will first expose a and the next step I will expose B so they are not actually made together they are made just this one first at a time and this one at the other time so there will be another B here so in in between B's there is more spacing and then between A's there is more spacing and they are very complex design rules to manage A and B independently so this is called colored layout so a is one color and b is another color you seriously yes so is there something special with 193 nanometer light that we are using just to manufacture even smaller yeah this is arden-based laser okay so and that was the so how how do you get this wavelength of light how do you get any light source if we studied that in physics Optics 11 12 also how do you get a light source what happens electrons jump from one level to another yeah electrons go to the outer level outer orbital and they fall to an inner orbital and as they fall they release energy because in an orbital has lower energy and that energy comes out as light so you cannot say that I will get 193 nanometer light and now tomorrow I will want 188 nanometer light no it doesn't happen like that the you know you have to find a material which will which will be able to give you that light and we're not talking about lasers what does a laser mean that this just one wavelength of light so typically when you look at your tube light it would generate wavelengths in different in the entire visible spectrum is it not all the wavelengths of light in the visible spectrum it will generate but the laser pointer that you have it will only generate infrared or red or some particular wavelength of light so you're talking about lasers of different uh wavelengths three materials to be able to generate that is it not yes so but we can use other techniques like we may be doing by some means we can do fabrication inside a medium that is optically denser so wavelength so that is what we so that is already done we use immersional lipography you asked me about how does 193 figure it 193 figures and because the material which is used to generate that laser is generating 193 nanometers finding a different material as a material scientist work and it is ongoing at a very very high Pace that is how you finally arrived at UV euv machines also that we were talking about in the last class because we could find the different materials but generating this light is here is also difficult yes more importantly you need a laser uh so just the save length of light no other wavelength then you need to ensure that whatever the slide source is it can generate light for longer durations of time so that this light carries some energy with it and is able to expose and is able to work on the photoresist you need some energy to also be a part of it does that wavelength and two and two photons is not sufficient you need a sufficient number of photons to be there to be able to react with the photoresis there you need some wattage then it should be sustainable it should be able to work for 24 hours a day 365 365 days a year because otherwise uh your production will have to stop every now and then you see there are so many constraints yes sir thank you okay Faisal you had a question in this 193 nanometer technology if we need a and b 193 nanometer lights We Want A and B to be closed so that is why we are using two Mass because it cannot be possible with with this 193 the fraction will the fraction will not let it happen that is why we were saying with 13 nanometer we can have uh A and B closer on the same on the same mask and that is how the number yes and that is why we reduce the mass cost yeah okay okay so what is this term colored layout you have used color layout means that uh see otherwise poly is just poly for example you just make all the polys same way color layout means that now there are two colors in the layout poly also is of two colors so have you seen a layout in your refresher course yes sir so you see a red color could be used for poly green for active and so on yes sir so all poly was red only you know yes sir in in 16th and fat or in Advanced Technologies you will see poly is also in two colors red and yellow let us say but it is in two colors because they are coming from different Mass here yes okay because if you want to manufacture them in different marks and so this is because we're doing because we have to be we want to uh counter the effects of diffraction right yes because we want to use this cheaper source of light 190 nanometer light still as long as possible euv is costlier okay answer what was the concept of dummy poly that how is different from this one because uh in both we are manufacturing for in one we are making more masks in dual partnering but in dummy poly what you're doing dummy poly is for example I just wanted to make a okay I just wanted to make an a this is simply not possible to make an a which is let us say 16 nanometer wide so what you do is you also there is no sufficient energy in the light it's because the wavelength of light is 193 nanometer in a slit of 60 nanometer nothing will come true so what you do is you also make slits here so that the light diffracted from here will also reach here and expose the photoresis down here so this is called as dummy poly okay so we are basically doing some technique within the same mask itself yeah this is all objects okay okay but here in dummy here because of dummy poly we're not increasing any Mass cost right no no yes what is happening is that you may actually end up so the next poly could only be here now okay okay we are basically exploiting the diffraction part of it yes okay okay so I think till now you've already understood that vlsi is not just an Electronics job you have chemical Engineers material scientists physicists Optical Engineers Quantum physicists and everyone involved in making Electronics possible is this evident to you now yes yes there's not designers like you and me who have made vlsi hot it is someone else yes sir and Sir why did you said that the deposition was a back-end process that will be no so we will come to that okay then if you had a question yes sir uh when we talk that we are shrinking the technology so mask also gets smaller Mars would be uh mask size would depend on how big your die is if your die has become smaller then yes if your diet remains same then no listen eventually then we will I mean we will also be using these techniques for making masks so mask for a mask so mask see masks so you can actually use uh use uh plasma etching to make the mask kind of microscopic etching you can do to make the mask that is still possible only what really make every feature by hand mask you can make actually make every feature by hand yes sir okay that is why Mass making cost is very high in Advanced Technologies because features have to be more handcrafted than stuff like that okay so this is what I was talking about that as you go to Advanced Technologies mask costs are increasing okay and this despite we are going to 193 I I stands for immersion immersion means that you use uh use a liquid in the machine so that light passes through a liquid and overall numerical aperture changes and all the Optics comes in okay and because the you know Mass costs are so high it is extremely important it is extremely extremely important that whenever you put any design on Silicon it should be first time right you cannot have reruns on Silicon see software jobs are much easier you make a bug even then you know you've shipped the product to the customer and you will say oh there is an update on the air update update your phone fine a soft server can be corrected like that Hardware work once it is there then you have to go through the entire process of Hardware designing over and over again and the next product will come out only after six to seven months at the earliest so you cannot afford to have any bugs or errors left in your design when you sign it off okay so a quick review or a quick view of how fabrication happens so this is this is something that uh I myself also did in in my master's program because my University had a Fab a small Fab fabrication facility there but these photos are from a course from University of Maryland so you can check that out online but yeah so what what you do is you you make a field log site and then by exposing a light to a mask you after etching get something like this okay then as a Next Step you say that you would want to deposit poly silicon so you grow gate oxide and then you deposit polish silicon and you etch out polysilicon from areas there you do not want the gate so polysilicon and oxide are edged out from all this region and you get what you call as a polygate are you able to realize this is something like a polygate that you would have seen then you start to so this is how the images would the the microscopic images look like and you see this is the depth of the oxide that you had drawn that you had manufactured that you had grown and uh the polygate is there then you do the doping of the source and the drain which which results in this n plus and uh regions being designed and then you deposit metal once you deposit the metals what do you do um sorry not metal this is a oxide again in which you will then create these slits in these slips you will then make a contact on the silicon source and drain region you see these contacts appear like this this is the contact on the poly region the gate region these are the contacts on the source and drain and uh once you've made these contacts you deposit a metal and you remove the metal from the parts where you did not want the connection so this is how your die looks like now okay and I think this is uh the one that we worked on was something like 0.5 Micron Technology or something like that and you see this kind the you wanted you made a contact and you wanted to make a wire over it but you see what has happened such a large part of the contact there is no metal so if there is no metal it means silicon is contacted with metal through a lesser surface area so the real resistance of this contact will be higher than the resistance that you would you had wanted it to be are you able to see this you wanted this resistance this contact to be this big but in reality the contacted area is only this so the current flow is now happening through you know through a lesser area than earlier so the resistance of this contact will be higher than what you had intended it to be and this is just 0.5 Micron Technology today we are talking about five nanometer 1.5 now you see this is such inaccuracy so five nanometer code just to get five nanometer working the kind of precision you require in the machines is tremendous it's a lot of hard work to to ensure a working guide here okay a huge advancement in technology has enabled where we are today okay so now we just saw how the first metal is drawn so what is happening there are oxidation status where you make the gate dielectric you make intermittent dielectric and you also use oxide as mask for example when we had to deposit the metal we used oxide as the mask is it not wherever the metal uh wherever the oxide was not there metal wood could go down and contact with the source and drain region so oxidation is used for different purposes to deposit stuff we deposited the gate in the example we also deposited aluminum or the interconnects pattern removal means etching an implant implantation is dopants to modify the electrical you know doping the source and drain region so you see these steps were repeat were done over and over again some were done twice some are done once to be able to make the transistor that we just saw and when you do it over and over again when you do it over and over again you start to get what is called as uh multiple metal layers so not just one layer of metal but second third fourth so in a typical uh uh so even in the DK that you may have used during a fresher program you would have noticed you could go up to metal sticks metal seven and so on so those metals were just extra stories that were built over the basic metal structure there okay so we are in the slide which is called dual damaging process have any one of you heard about dual dimension yes sir what is dual damaging so basically you want to reduce a process step when we want to make a VR so we do the etching twice and make a via that is of metal itself we do not deposit anything else okay mother you wanted to ask something yes so how do we con so we can control the area and the shape of these of everything by using the mask but how do we control the height like the deposition height of let's say the metal oxide that we were depositing how do we control that type you deposit it for a longer duration of time okay so duration okay so longer duration means uh higher bigger yeah you could do that or you could uh let us say later on you do CMP which is called chemo mechanical polishing so even if you look at the previous slides you know uh what we were showing was that uh see what happens do you think this this oxide was always this thick was it always this this thick only no when you had fabricated the oxide it would have been slightly wavy you polished it so that is called CMP chemo mechanical planarization so use chemicals and you use mechanical scrubbing to polish planarize the surface so when you do this you can actually plannerize it a little more and have lesser thickness there is it not yes sir so you could change the duration to increase or decrease the thickness and then CMP is the process through which you can finally arrive at the exact thickness that you needed okay so so while doing a metal one deposition you said that we can use the oxide as a mask so but exactly we're not using oxide as mass because where to H in the oxide that for that also you'll be using some other kind of yeah so I think the oxide there was a different mask but for depositing the metal oxide is the mass is it not okay okay okay fine fine so answer one more thing so in a previous slide uh you said that uh there was a point mentioned that using diffraction to enhance the resolution that wasn't clear to me so Productions you will see that in diffraction and when when when a large wavelength of light passes through a slit which has lesser width lesser uh you know a width which is a slit which is smaller than the wavelength of light like the facts yes sir yes sir yeah multiple slits placed to each other and placed close to each other light from the adjacent slits will also come below this first letter yes sir yes sir in so the kind of energy that comes below the first one would be significant enough now to be able to cause the etching whereas the common light falling below slit two and would be lesser than that okay so we're talking about the interference interference and the fractions we're talking about hardcore Optics there okay okay sorry okay okay so for others if it is really going over your head don't worry this is not a course on Optics this is not a course on fabrication also this is just an introduction to fabrication that we want that I want you to have so that you can then choose your coursework appropriately or you get to you know if someone is asking you a question on vlsi in in our interview you know have a well-rounded view of everything even if you have not done that exact course you have better understanding of the overall ecosystem there okay that is why I'm just covering it so don't need to worry too much about it mother you have a question okay so as within the said so that dual Dimension process is used to reduce a process step uh it may not be as intuitive to all of you on yet but let me explain it to you see in a typical manufacturing process what you do is you if you look at the this side first what you do is you you know make an oxide you put a when deposit a photo resist you do whatever you expose light you then etch when you etch you are able to make these holes in your system so that these holes will now allow or deposit metal layers and whatever you can so you would do this step for making a contact you will do this step for making a via so a contact is from Silicon to metal one okay and a via is from any other metal metal one select a five pack to the next metal layer metal two select a six packs okay so contact is made out of tungsten Vias initially let us say until 130 nanometer technology also vrs are made out of tungsten y tungsten we will just come to that but till that time we also made out of tungsten after 130 nanometer and wires at that time were made out of aluminum in in more Advanced Technologies wires are today made out of copper so why do we need to shift to Copper from aluminum this is the physical property of copper versus aluminum inductility ductility that purpose you can make much thinner wires and as you go to more advanced symmetry you wanted thinner wires additionally copper is less resistive than aluminum if you are making a thin wire its resistance would increase but by going to Copper you could reduce the resistivity also,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh6qhtM88KM,"Link:

Transcript: so this is the next slide so if you rotate the wafer what happens so until I would say uh 2002 2004 2006 so this is this is February 20 2006 look at this huh so until this time uh Wafers were made in this kind of a format one one zero so it says that your current would flow in one one zero Direction okay but uh Thomas Scott Nikki hmm proposed in 2006. to rotate the substrate such that current would flow in one zero zero Direction now why was this required or and what how did it help so the fact is that in Silicon there are uh two kinds of holes some are light holes so light holes means that the gradation of change of your electric electrostatic field is is sharp and some are heavy holes so if you look into this direction or you know this this hole if you look into this plane this hole would be a heavy hole so in the standard Wafers there were light holes and also heavy holes because uh there was a direction of movement which considered this bad slope and also the so this was symmetrical it's escalated whole whole Mobility was not changing but for this the whole Mobility was changing if you would move in One Direction or the other but when you rotated the wafer what happened when you rotated the wave so you came to this you came to this part of the wafer where this extra lobe was not not a part of your current flow and therefore rotated Wafers also had light holes only so overall mobility of the of the holes improved what does improved whole whole mobility mean that now to get the same current I can have a smaller device so the p2n ratio which was traditionally kept to be something like uh between 2.5 and 3 from this technology onwards which was I think 65 or yeah 65 onwards whole Mobility was significantly improved and you could have P by and ratio closer to two whole Mobility was still worse than electron Mobility but it significantly improved just because you rotated the wafer okay and there was actually no change in electron Mobility because for electrons whether the Wafers are rotated or not the effective weight was same so vulnerability to improved electromobility remains same no degradation on the electron mobility and you've got a win-win kind of a solution you could say more area okay sir that is the importance of understanding what the notch means and how to use the notch yes slither because of the mobility the effective mass is changing or because of the effective mass of Mobility because of the effective Mass Mobility is changing okay okay Mobility is a behavior which depends on the mass a heavier substance would move slower yes sir understood yeah okay so once the wafer is ready you know that I have to use rotated substrate and everything then you go into the manufacturing phase and interestingly in Silicon manufacturing there are a few steps which are just repeated over and over again these are implantation oxidation and deposition so implantation is in fact a front-end process and deposition is then subsequently a backend process so what are we saying that you will make layers of so this is my silicon wafer let us say yeah so you will first implant something onto it after you've implanted you will make a layer of oxide okay then you will deposit something on it which which you would call as a photoresist and then you will remove this photoresist in a patterned manner okay so you will remove it from here let us say so over here you have created a window such that this oxide becomes now visible to incident light so when the light will come it will now be able to fall here but not fall here okay stuff like that so pattern removal and then again implementation implantation or patent removal or oxidation or the position of some of these steps would come you just repeat these over and over again and you're finally able to build your silicon die consider it like this if I have to make a 20 storage building what do I need to do let us let us assume that you have come to the ground level now so what do I need to do I need to make pillars I need to make the walls I need to make the roof for the next level I again need to grow the pillars more I need to make the balls I need to make the roof or whatever pillars roof wall pillars roof wall filler's roof wall and I can go to as many stories as I want to in a similar manner the Silicon manufacturing process also use this the same steps to overall build the wafer over and over again to make multiple layers of metals and so on ticket so this is a primer and this is an example in fact Let us look at an example over here we had a silicon substrate we drew oxide on it or we deposited oxide on it then we deposited photoresist on it then we expose this photoresist they expose this photoresist to a glass mask so you see over here there is a black black line there so light will not pass but over here the glass is transparent so light would pass and this part of the photoresist would get exposed to this light now this photoresist it why is it called a photoresist because it is sensitive to photons it is sensitive to light its chemical properties would change when light falls on it so then you clean this wafer which was already exposed with a acid let us say hydrofluoric acid address and this this part which was exposed that would go away now what you do after this part goes away now what you do you etch h means you remove whatever is available uh visible from the top now so this photoresist is hardened it cannot be etched but the remaining oxide which you had deposited in this phase it will be etched so now you have this kind of a structure in there what will you do now you will remove the photoresist and you will let us say implant boron what would happen Boron would not go beneath this oxide layer but over here you will form a p plus region huh are you able to see this then when you need to make the next layer all that you need to do is again deposit oxide so your gain deposit oxide you again put a photoresist you again expose now a different part and uh so after that after you expose that part then something can be deposited over here in this region okay we will look at it in a little more we will exemplify it a little more in a few minutes but what is essentially happening is that you have a light source and a condenser so we are talking about Optics now so condenser would what does our collimator do condenser do it makes all the rays of light parallel so what happens then this is this is exposed to a mask where there are Parts which are blacked out so that light cannot pass through it and then after the mask there is a projection lens which will again refocus these parallel lights into converging lights and you will be able to expose underlying silicon wafer so this is Wafer already written there you will expose the underlying silicon wafer with light okay so as I mentioned 190c nanometer light has been used for all these technos even in someone people even tried 16 nanometer with 193 nanometer light it does not very so there is lots of diffraction lots of things that come into picture but people have even manufactured 16 nanometer chips with uh 192 nanometer light so what they need to do is to manage the diffraction path they need to say that okay uh if you want to make this kind of a poly you make slits in The Mask you make dummy Pollies around it for this distance so that after diffraction I am able to achieve this poly shape accurately so there are rules that are design rules that are added to be able to enable use of 196 nanometers even at Advanced Technologies There Are Rules which say that two polies uh if they are this close let us say then they will be made on two masks so this will be mask a and this will be mask B so this is called dual patterning why two masks because they cannot really be drawn this close with the 192 nanometer light there there will be diffraction and the one of the gates would die out so you say okay I will first expose a and the next step I will expose B so they are not actually made together they are made just this one first at a time and this one at the other time so there will be another B here so in in between B's there is more spacing and then between A's there is more spacing and they are very complex design rules to manage A and B independently so this is called colored layout so a is one color and b is another color you seriously yes so is there something special with 193 nanometer light that we are using just to manufacture even smaller yeah this is arden-based laser okay so and that was the so how how do you get this wavelength of light how do you get any light source if we studied that in physics Optics 11 12 also how do you get a light source what happens electrons jump from one level to another yeah electrons go to the outer level outer orbital and they fall to an inner orbital and as they fall they release energy because in an orbital has lower energy and that energy comes out as light so you cannot say that I will get 193 nanometer light and now tomorrow I will want 188 nanometer light no it doesn't happen like that the you know you have to find a material which will which will be able to give you that light and we're not talking about lasers what does a laser mean that this just one wavelength of light so typically when you look at your tube light it would generate wavelengths in different in the entire visible spectrum is it not all the wavelengths of light in the visible spectrum it will generate but the laser pointer that you have it will only generate infrared or red or some particular wavelength of light so you're talking about lasers of different uh wavelengths three materials to be able to generate that is it not yes so but we can use other techniques like we may be doing by some means we can do fabrication inside a medium that is optically denser so wavelength so that is what we so that is already done we use immersional lipography you asked me about how does 193 figure it 193 figures and because the material which is used to generate that laser is generating 193 nanometers finding a different material as a material scientist work and it is ongoing at a very very high Pace that is how you finally arrived at UV euv machines also that we were talking about in the last class because we could find the different materials but generating this light is here is also difficult yes more importantly you need a laser uh so just the save length of light no other wavelength then you need to ensure that whatever the slide source is it can generate light for longer durations of time so that this light carries some energy with it and is able to expose and is able to work on the photoresist you need some energy to also be a part of it does that wavelength and two and two photons is not sufficient you need a sufficient number of photons to be there to be able to react with the photoresis there you need some wattage then it should be sustainable it should be able to work for 24 hours a day 365 365 days a year because otherwise uh your production will have to stop every now and then you see there are so many constraints yes sir thank you okay Faisal you had a question in this 193 nanometer technology if we need a and b 193 nanometer lights We Want A and B to be closed so that is why we are using two Mass because it cannot be possible with with this 193 the fraction will the fraction will not let it happen that is why we were saying with 13 nanometer we can have uh A and B closer on the same on the same mask and that is how the number yes and that is why we reduce the mass cost yeah okay okay so what is this term colored layout you have used color layout means that uh see otherwise poly is just poly for example you just make all the polys same way color layout means that now there are two colors in the layout poly also is of two colors so have you seen a layout in your refresher course yes sir so you see a red color could be used for poly green for active and so on yes sir so all poly was red only you know yes sir in in 16th and fat or in Advanced Technologies you will see poly is also in two colors red and yellow let us say but it is in two colors because they are coming from different Mass here yes okay because if you want to manufacture them in different marks and so this is because we're doing because we have to be we want to uh counter the effects of diffraction right yes because we want to use this cheaper source of light 190 nanometer light still as long as possible euv is costlier okay answer what was the concept of dummy poly that how is different from this one because uh in both we are manufacturing for in one we are making more masks in dual partnering but in dummy poly what you're doing dummy poly is for example I just wanted to make a okay I just wanted to make an a this is simply not possible to make an a which is let us say 16 nanometer wide so what you do is you also there is no sufficient energy in the light it's because the wavelength of light is 193 nanometer in a slit of 60 nanometer nothing will come true so what you do is you also make slits here so that the light diffracted from here will also reach here and expose the photoresis down here so this is called as dummy poly okay so we are basically doing some technique within the same mask itself yeah this is all objects okay okay but here in dummy here because of dummy poly we're not increasing any Mass cost right no no yes what is happening is that you may actually end up so the next poly could only be here now okay okay we are basically exploiting the diffraction part of it yes okay okay so I think till now you've already understood that vlsi is not just an Electronics job you have chemical Engineers material scientists physicists Optical Engineers Quantum physicists and everyone involved in making Electronics possible is this evident to you now yes yes there's not designers like you and me who have made vlsi hot it is someone else yes sir and Sir why did you said that the deposition was a back-end process that will be no so we will come to that okay then if you had a question yes sir uh when we talk that we are shrinking the technology so mask also gets smaller Mars would be uh mask size would depend on how big your die is if your die has become smaller then yes if your diet remains same then no listen eventually then we will I mean we will also be using these techniques for making masks so mask for a mask so mask see masks so you can actually use uh use uh plasma etching to make the mask kind of microscopic etching you can do to make the mask that is still possible only what really make every feature by hand mask you can make actually make every feature by hand yes sir okay that is why Mass making cost is very high in Advanced Technologies because features have to be more handcrafted than stuff like that okay so this is what I was talking about that as you go to Advanced Technologies mask costs are increasing okay and this despite we are going to 193 I I stands for immersion immersion means that you use uh use a liquid in the machine so that light passes through a liquid and overall numerical aperture changes and all the Optics comes in okay and because the you know Mass costs are so high it is extremely important it is extremely extremely important that whenever you put any design on Silicon it should be first time right you cannot have reruns on Silicon see software jobs are much easier you make a bug even then you know you've shipped the product to the customer and you will say oh there is an update on the air update update your phone fine a soft server can be corrected like that Hardware work once it is there then you have to go through the entire process of Hardware designing over and over again and the next product will come out only after six to seven months at the earliest so you cannot afford to have any bugs or errors left in your design when you sign it off okay so a quick review or a quick view of how fabrication happens so this is this is something that uh I myself also did in in my master's program because my University had a Fab a small Fab fabrication facility there but these photos are from a course from University of Maryland so you can check that out online but yeah so what what you do is you you make a field log site and then by exposing a light to a mask you after etching get something like this okay then as a Next Step you say that you would want to deposit poly silicon so you grow gate oxide and then you deposit polish silicon and you etch out polysilicon from areas there you do not want the gate so polysilicon and oxide are edged out from all this region and you get what you call as a polygate are you able to realize this is something like a polygate that you would have seen then you start to so this is how the images would the the microscopic images look like and you see this is the depth of the oxide that you had drawn that you had manufactured that you had grown and uh the polygate is there then you do the doping of the source and the drain which which results in this n plus and uh regions being designed and then you deposit metal once you deposit the metals what do you do um sorry not metal this is a oxide again in which you will then create these slits in these slips you will then make a contact on the silicon source and drain region you see these contacts appear like this this is the contact on the poly region the gate region these are the contacts on the source and drain and uh once you've made these contacts you deposit a metal and you remove the metal from the parts where you did not want the connection so this is how your die looks like now okay and I think this is uh the one that we worked on was something like 0.5 Micron Technology or something like that and you see this kind the you wanted you made a contact and you wanted to make a wire over it but you see what has happened such a large part of the contact there is no metal so if there is no metal it means silicon is contacted with metal through a lesser surface area so the real resistance of this contact will be higher than the resistance that you would you had wanted it to be are you able to see this you wanted this resistance this contact to be this big but in reality the contacted area is only this so the current flow is now happening through you know through a lesser area than earlier so the resistance of this contact will be higher than what you had intended it to be and this is just 0.5 Micron Technology today we are talking about five nanometer 1.5 now you see this is such inaccuracy so five nanometer code just to get five nanometer working the kind of precision you require in the machines is tremendous it's a lot of hard work to to ensure a working guide here okay a huge advancement in technology has enabled where we are today okay so now we just saw how the first metal is drawn so what is happening there are oxidation status where you make the gate dielectric you make intermittent dielectric and you also use oxide as mask for example when we had to deposit the metal we used oxide as the mask is it not wherever the metal uh wherever the oxide was not there metal wood could go down and contact with the source and drain region so oxidation is used for different purposes to deposit stuff we deposited the gate in the example we also deposited aluminum or the interconnects pattern removal means etching an implant implantation is dopants to modify the electrical you know doping the source and drain region so you see these steps were repeat were done over and over again some were done twice some are done once to be able to make the transistor that we just saw and when you do it over and over again when you do it over and over again you start to get what is called as uh multiple metal layers so not just one layer of metal but second third fourth so in a typical uh uh so even in the DK that you may have used during a fresher program you would have noticed you could go up to metal sticks metal seven and so on so those metals were just extra stories that were built over the basic metal structure there okay so we are in the slide which is called dual damaging process have any one of you heard about dual dimension yes sir what is dual damaging so basically you want to reduce a process step when we want to make a VR so we do the etching twice and make a via that is of metal itself we do not deposit anything else okay mother you wanted to ask something yes so how do we con so we can control the area and the shape of these of everything by using the mask but how do we control the height like the deposition height of let's say the metal oxide that we were depositing how do we control that type you deposit it for a longer duration of time okay so duration okay so longer duration means uh higher bigger yeah you could do that or you could uh let us say later on you do CMP which is called chemo mechanical polishing so even if you look at the previous slides you know uh what we were showing was that uh see what happens do you think this this oxide was always this thick was it always this this thick only no when you had fabricated the oxide it would have been slightly wavy you polished it so that is called CMP chemo mechanical planarization so use chemicals and you use mechanical scrubbing to polish planarize the surface so when you do this you can actually plannerize it a little more and have lesser thickness there is it not yes sir so you could change the duration to increase or decrease the thickness and then CMP is the process through which you can finally arrive at the exact thickness that you needed okay so so while doing a metal one deposition you said that we can use the oxide as a mask so but exactly we're not using oxide as mass because where to H in the oxide that for that also you'll be using some other kind of yeah so I think the oxide there was a different mask but for depositing the metal oxide is the mass is it not okay okay okay fine fine so answer one more thing so in a previous slide uh you said that uh there was a point mentioned that using diffraction to enhance the resolution that wasn't clear to me so Productions you will see that in diffraction and when when when a large wavelength of light passes through a slit which has lesser width lesser uh you know a width which is a slit which is smaller than the wavelength of light like the facts yes sir yes sir yeah multiple slits placed to each other and placed close to each other light from the adjacent slits will also come below this first letter yes sir yes sir in so the kind of energy that comes below the first one would be significant enough now to be able to cause the etching whereas the common light falling below slit two and would be lesser than that okay so we're talking about the interference interference and the fractions we're talking about hardcore Optics there okay okay sorry okay okay so for others if it is really going over your head don't worry this is not a course on Optics this is not a course on fabrication also this is just an introduction to fabrication that we want that I want you to have so that you can then choose your coursework appropriately or you get to you know if someone is asking you a question on vlsi in in our interview you know have a well-rounded view of everything even if you have not done that exact course you have better understanding of the overall ecosystem there okay that is why I'm just covering it so don't need to worry too much about it mother you have a question okay so as within the said so that dual Dimension process is used to reduce a process step uh it may not be as intuitive to all of you on yet but let me explain it to you see in a typical manufacturing process what you do is you if you look at the this side first what you do is you you know make an oxide you put a when deposit a photo resist you do whatever you expose light you then etch when you etch you are able to make these holes in your system so that these holes will

also vrs are made out of tungsten y tungsten we will just come to that but till that time we also made out of tungsten after 130 nanometer and wires at that time were made out of aluminum in in more Advanced Technologies wires are today made out of copper so why do we need to shift to Copper from aluminum this is the physical property of copper versus aluminum inductility ductility that purpose you can make much thinner wires and as you go to more advanced symmetry you wanted thinner wires additionally copper is less resistive than aluminum if you are making a thin wire its resistance would increase but by going to Copper you could reduce the resistivity also"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,1VGPTGZ8e_Q,it is more ductile why were we not using copper even earlier why were we using aluminum earlier why we wanted thick wires with this so you could always make thick wires with copper also there would be still lesser resistance did not have the technology copper wire all your house fittings are also copper wire so maybe the it the copper interacts with the kind of may lead to some kind of effect that we wouldn't we won't be wanting or it could it is doing something to the process to the whatever we are trying to manufacture not getting the product right maybe that could be the thing some kind of undesired effects may be coming to play maybe okay should they be sorry using copper introduces more contact resistances in the active regions more resistance oh copper to lessen the aluminium uh sorry show some effects with the oxide layer as well so it gets diffused or conditions and that's why we use tungsten okay so what happens is copper copper gold and silver when they interact with silicon they create energy states inside the band gap deep inside the band gap see why is silicon a very good semiconductor because it has a band gap of 1.12 electron volts all of you remember this 1.12 electron volts so this band gap what does it ensure that the electrons over here here have to dump have to be given of energy of at least one dot to 1.12 volts so that they will start to conduct so this is the switching for behavior of a mosfet or any device also that you apply some voltage so that electron you kind of surmount this band gap and stuff and electrons go from here to here you need that kind of voltage and that is where it is a semiconductor now what copper gold and silver do is they make intermediate energy states in the middle of this band gap so now an electron can easily jump from here to here and then with the same energy kind of stuff move from here to here so now instead of 1.12 you require a voltage of only let us say 0.57 to conduct so your semiconductor no longer is as good as it was earlier okay so that is why copper usage was avoided in the semiconductor manufacturing process for a very very long time until we were hit with the volca of copper okay so everywhere there is copper today but the contacts still remain to be tungsten why because you do not want copper to come in contact with silicon at all so in fact in fabs the copper part of the fab is physically handed 200 meter 300 meters far away from the front and part of the fab where contacts are made so you make you do processing on wafers until contact level over here and then you physically shift the wafers to the other side there are there is a different clean room all together which you will need to go to and then you will do the processing of metal one and upwards okay so contacts continue to be tungsten vrs have moved from uh tungsten to copper because with copper you could do a different thing with copper what you could do was you could make two tiers of etching so up you see first year of etching para and then what you did you deposited the resist on it again and you made another exposure and with that after that exposure you made the second level of etching done so now when you deposit copper over here you will make a vr and also the metal in one step so this saves cost this is called as dual dynasty process which was enabled by copper and the major you know it really changed the way we handle handle devices because as soon as dual damaging process was enabled defectivity reduced significantly and you could go to many more number of metal layers so until there was aluminum you could only think of four or five metal layers but today you can very easily think of even 11 12 metal layers every extra meter layer is extra cost but at least if you want you can get them because of the dual dimension process okay so yes so how uh so before the 130 nanometer we were using aluminium for wires but for veya we are we are using different kind of things function okay for via viewing test and then aluminium but now we are using for via and wire copper yes so but then how it is reducing the defectivity i mean you just mentioned okay so you tell me one thing i make one step and i let us say i have to make a how do we put it i have to you'll be okay we just saw an example now we made contacts and then we deposited metal over it what happened there was more defectivity because there were two different steps is it not yeah yes sir yes so if i were to if i were to make the contacts and uh metals in one step it will automatically always fill the contacts for lena okay okay so basically we are we are reducing the cost the defectivity due to misalignments okay okay we are doing the deposition only once yeah okay it is flowing okay fine sir so overall cost of your chip would reduce yeah okay so okay so dual dimension process enabled that uh what we really need to realize is that with copper because we just understood that copper can diffuse into silicon and can lead to uh interstitials those intermediate states and completely spoil the functioning of your of your device so for copper you need to be extremely careful and you need to put a barrier around copper copper wires so that this copper doesn't diffuse out of the wire region otherwise copper will very easily diffuse into the oxide and from oxide it will very easily go into the substrate also so you need to make this barrier now when you were at 65 nanometers what happened you made a barrier which was uh say five nanometers thick and you were still fine but as you go to a finer geometry what happens now the barrier rate has not changed but your wire width has reduced so the effective resistance increases significantly so we are continuously looking for as we go to advanced technologies we are continuously looking for advanced barrier materials also okay let's say this was a pvd couple form cathode plasma deposition and this is atomic layer deposition you actually deposit this atom by atom so we are going to advance technology so that this barrier thickness we can reduce somehow so using copper has improved yield has improved stuff but it has also led to more complexity in manufacturing processes we will look into this aspect a little in in more detail later also okay so what do we do see we are almost done with the class time but there are three or four more slides should i continue or do we want me to stop and then continue in the next class so is it okay face stop right now it's already too much not that actually it's friday and if i miss the namaz then i have to go 10 to 11 kilometers then that's why okay okay so would you be okay by watching the recording or if others are okay can we just continue for five more minutes and then you can watch the last five minutes of recording later is that okay okay yeah that will be okay it was recording so we will be sharing anyways you okay okay if there is some question you can ask me in the office okay okay thank you thank you sir others are you okay with another five minutes of the class yes sir yes because then that will we will complete the fabrication part and we will move to the devices in the next class it will make it you know a consistent thing then okay and uh if you're tired and you want to leave you can you can watch the recording the file last five minutes later also okay so uh we said that fabrication is a piece of art you know you see that we wanted to fabricate a wire like this but we ended up fabricating something else we also did an experiment that if i want to did we do that experiment okay let us do it now uh you have a pen and a paper with you you write your name exactly the same way 10 times you write your name 10 times trying to make it make each each version a replica of the earlier ones please please do that write your name 10 times once you are done put a plus one in the chart window you know why i'm asking you to write your name because your name is the most you know wonderful sound to your ears you hear it the most so this is the most beautiful sound for you i want you to write your name 10 times trying to match the earlier versions and then tell me all the 10 words exactly the same or not were they the same are all the ten versions no sir no sir what happened there were some variations that came up i just asked you to write your name ten times how many transistors do you want to make on every die million billions billions of transistors and you're talking of a machine to manufacture millions of transistors exactly the same way can it ever happen no sir no there will be what is called as variations so as we go to advanced technologies this variability starts to bother us come to think of it like that in 65 nanometer technology the gate oxide thickness is only 12 angstroms which is only two to three molecules of silicon dioxide add one more molecule and what has happened the gate of right thickness has changed by 25 to 30 percent let us look at the gate length let us say i etched the end the length a little more so but instead of uh uh 65 60 nanometers i ended up manufacturing 65 uh 55 what happens performance improves a bit eight percent performance change leakage goes by more than thirty percent sixty sixty kilo i ended up making fifty five now let us say this five nanometer error i make in a 22 nanometer technology with 18 nanometer gate length what happens now so over here what was the error okay the error was less than 10 what would be the error over here if i make a 5 nanometer error it will be almost 30 are you able to see this so small errors which were handleable or manageable with some margins and earlier technologies are today come completely unacceptable so when we go to advanced technologies not only do we need to work on wavelength of light and this and that you also need to work a lot on instrumentation so that your instruments are very very accurate so scaling is not just about you and me and electronics engineers any longer it is all about a lot of technology people making it work for us are you able to see this any questions okay so in this slide what is this uh high kid electric thing which i mentioned and we'll come to that later high k dielectric so uh what happens is an advanced technologies uh so already see the gate oxide was 12 angstroms two to three molecules of silicon dioxide when you scale you need to go to an effective oxide thickness of eight angstroms yes sir so that is just one to two atoms one to two molecules you see the variability would increase so much so what was done was instead of silicon dioxide as the gate dielectric we used high k materials as gate dielectric so that physical thickness of the oxide would be something of the order of 20 angstroms but in terms of silicon dioxide the effective thickness would be in the ratio of the high k so effectively gate oxide thickness is eight eight angstroms but physical gate of site sickness because of a high k dielectric is 20 angstroms so variability reduces okay so now we are playing with the chemical properties of that yes okay materials okay so we mentioned about clean rooms there are huge range of you know different standards of clean rooms and uh you see there was a class hundred thousand clean room earlier we felt it was good enough we came to class one and we realized the clean room capability is no longer good enough so we had to define a completely different standard an iso standard where further advanced clean rooms have a name which the earlier terminology did not even have okay and these clean rooms are are really like sacred places if you want to enter into a clean room you have to wear extra layers of of clothing over your regular clothing that's a you know you see all these that doctors have been wearing in this cove with times so the technology engineers we have two such kits every time they enter into a clean room a very high pressure is maintained inside the clean room so that even if you open the door because of high pressure the air would come out of the clean room and not enter so no dust can enter into the clean room from outside so high pressure is maintained yellow light is used so that even by accident you do not expose any photoresist or anything and as i already mentioned as a plate in clean room for implant at wafer level and deposition of copper so clean rooms uh are something that are again you know completely logistics management of a vlsi facility is a completely different beast so my attempt over here is just to share with you so many people ensure that you and i are able to design what we are designing well okay uh this is so whatever we design we have to test and uh only good stuff only good wafers and good dies need to be shipped to customers so there are a range of tests that every dye needs to go through and you know a test equipment just one machine could be one million dollars today machines are actually much costlier even five million dollars and 10 million dollars machines are there because you have to test so many devices you have to operate them at a higher frequency so machines have also become costlier and realize that the over of the overall cost of test a huge 57 percent of the cost even at this time was depreciation cost so there is a huge research effort that we as designers are also taking up to reduce the test the cost of test so in even in my group you're working quite extensively on reducing the cost of test for okay for sams in my group but yeah across the board people are working on on methods to reduce the cost of tests,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VGPTGZ8e_Q,"Link:

Transcript: it is more ductile why were we not using copper even earlier why were we using aluminum earlier why we wanted thick wires with this so you could always make thick wires with copper also there would be still lesser resistance did not have the technology copper wire all your house fittings are also copper wire so maybe the it the copper interacts with the kind of may lead to some kind of effect that we wouldn't we won't be wanting or it could it is doing something to the process to the whatever we are trying to manufacture not getting the product right maybe that could be the thing some kind of undesired effects may be coming to play maybe okay should they be sorry using copper introduces more contact resistances in the active regions more resistance oh copper to lessen the aluminium uh sorry show some effects with the oxide layer as well so it gets diffused or conditions and that's why we use tungsten okay so what happens is copper copper gold and silver when they interact with silicon they create energy states inside the band gap deep inside the band gap see why is silicon a very good semiconductor because it has a band gap of 1.12 electron volts all of you remember this 1.12 electron volts so this band gap what does it ensure that the electrons over here here have to dump have to be given of energy of at least one dot to 1.12 volts so that they will start to conduct so this is the switching for behavior of a mosfet or any device also that you apply some voltage so that electron you kind of surmount this band gap and stuff and electrons go from here to here you need that kind of voltage and that is where it is a semiconductor now what copper gold and silver do is they make intermediate energy states in the middle of this band gap so now an electron can easily jump from here to here and then with the same energy kind of stuff move from here to here so now instead of 1.12 you require a voltage of only let us say 0.57 to conduct so your semiconductor no longer is as good as it was earlier okay so that is why copper usage was avoided in the semiconductor manufacturing process for a very very long time until we were hit with the volca of copper okay so everywhere there is copper today but the contacts still remain to be tungsten why because you do not want copper to come in contact with silicon at all so in fact in fabs the copper part of the fab is physically handed 200 meter 300 meters far away from the front and part of the fab where contacts are made so you make you do processing on wafers until contact level over here and then you physically shift the wafers to the other side there are there is a different clean room all together which you will need to go to and then you will do the processing of metal one and upwards okay so contacts continue to be tungsten vrs have moved from uh tungsten to copper because with copper you could do a different thing with copper what you could do was you could make two tiers of etching so up you see first year of etching para and then what you did you deposited the resist on it again and you made another exposure and with that after that exposure you made the second level of etching done so now when you deposit copper over here you will make a vr and also the metal in one step so this saves cost this is called as dual dynasty process which was enabled by copper and the major you know it really changed the way we handle handle devices because as soon as dual damaging process was enabled defectivity reduced significantly and you could go to many more number of metal layers so until there was aluminum you could only think of four or five metal layers but today you can very easily think of even 11 12 metal layers every extra meter layer is extra cost but at least if you want you can get them because of the dual dimension process okay so yes so how uh so before the 130 nanometer we were using aluminium for wires but for veya we are we are using different kind of things function okay for via viewing test and then aluminium but now we are using for via and wire copper yes so but then how it is reducing the defectivity i mean you just mentioned okay so you tell me one thing i make one step and i let us say i have to make a how do we put it i have to you'll be okay we just saw an example now we made contacts and then we deposited metal over it what happened there was more defectivity because there were two different steps is it not yeah yes sir yes so if i were to if i were to make the contacts and uh metals in one step it will automatically always fill the contacts for lena okay okay so basically we are we are reducing the cost the defectivity due to misalignments okay okay we are doing the deposition only once yeah okay it is flowing okay fine sir so overall cost of your chip would reduce yeah okay so okay so dual dimension process enabled that uh what we really need to realize is that with copper because we just understood that copper can diffuse into silicon and can lead to uh interstitials those intermediate states and completely spoil the functioning of your of your device so for copper you need to be extremely careful and you need to put a barrier around copper copper wires so that this copper doesn't diffuse out of the wire region otherwise copper will very easily diffuse into the oxide and from oxide it will very easily go into the substrate also so you need to make this barrier now when you were at 65 nanometers what happened you made a barrier which was uh say five nanometers thick and you were still fine but as you go to a finer geometry what happens now the barrier rate has not changed but your wire width has reduced so the effective resistance increases significantly so we are continuously looking for as we go to advanced technologies we are continuously looking for advanced barrier materials also okay let's say this was a pvd couple form cathode plasma deposition and this is atomic layer deposition you actually deposit this atom by atom so we are going to advance technology so that this barrier thickness we can reduce somehow so using copper has improved yield has improved stuff but it has also led to more complexity in manufacturing processes we will look into this aspect a little in in more detail later also okay so what do we do see we are almost done with the class time but there are three or four more slides should i continue or do we want me to stop and then continue in the next class so is it okay face stop right now it's already too much not that actually it's friday and if i miss the namaz then i have to go 10 to 11 kilometers then that's why okay okay so would you be okay by watching the recording or if others are okay can we just continue for five more minutes and then you can watch the last five minutes of recording later is that okay okay yeah that will be okay it was recording so we will be sharing anyways you okay okay if there is some question you can ask me in the office okay okay thank you thank you sir others are you okay with another five minutes of the class yes sir yes because then that will we will complete the fabrication part and we will move to the devices in the next class it will make it you know a consistent thing then okay and uh if you're tired and you want to leave you can you can watch the recording the file last five minutes later also okay so uh we said that fabrication is a piece of art you know you see that we wanted to fabricate a wire like this but we ended up fabricating something else we also did an experiment that if i want to did we do that experiment okay let us do it now uh you have a pen and a paper with you you write your name exactly the same way 10 times you write your name 10 times trying to make it make each each version a replica of the earlier ones please please do that write your name 10 times once you are done put a plus one in the chart window you know why i'm asking you to write your name because your name is the most you know wonderful sound to your ears you hear it the most so this is the most beautiful sound for you i want you to write your name 10 times trying to match the earlier versions and then tell me all the 10 words exactly the same or not were they the same are all the ten versions no sir no sir what happened there were some variations that came up i just asked you to write your name ten times how many transistors do you want to make on every die million billions billions of transistors and you're talking of a machine to manufacture millions of transistors exactly the same way can it ever happen no sir no there will be what is called as variations so as we go to advanced technologies this variability starts to bother us come to think of it like that in 65 nanometer technology the gate oxide thickness is only 12 angstroms which is only two to three molecules of silicon dioxide add one more molecule and what has happened the gate of right thickness has changed by 25 to 30 percent let us look at the gate length let us say i etched the end the length a little more so but instead of uh uh 65 60 nanometers i ended up manufacturing 65 uh 55 what happens

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,w2JBCrDmuno,there is a huge research effort going on packaging because not just about uh you know it is not just about power power dissipation or stuff like that uh packaging when we talk about more than more and having a major and processor and memory in the same die so packaging is also becoming more complex there's a lot of research happening on packaging also and recently because we want more speeds that the typical inductive effects of the uh package start the figure in so just you know exposing you to different research areas as well with blsi and you know uh this is how the power the power generation on our chips has increased okay but this is how the air cooling capability is so air cooling capability has will remain largely constant is it not air can cool only this much can dissipate remove only this much of heat from a given area in a given amount of time after that you start to use fans and all that um but in reality today even in your mobile phone so if you look at qualcomm's latest chips specifications you will see mobile phone application processors also use what is called as liquid cooling so that you can just you can remove heat much faster and your chip can function at the required performance level okay so I think yeah this kind of brings me to the end of this session I know I had to choose the last few slides but frankly there was not much to know about or talk about except I wanted you to be introduced to these all these domains and challenges and dlsr Manufacturing processes also if you have any if you have any questions please shoot yes Mother so why are there only a handful of companies the world that looks at because just because it is so complex and so costly now only until you have very Deep Pockets you cannot afford to put that kind of money in there now so what stops the company like Reliance or Tata to make a fabrication facility indigenous fabrication facility oh indigenous fabrication facility in India so many many things you know uh first is that to be able to have a so first thing you realize is that Fab is costly such complex equipment such things need to be there so making a Fab setting a Fab is a very costly process are you able to understand this yes sir so then once you have a Fab made you would want to utilize a 24 course seven 365 days a week a year yes sir do you know one single Fab consumes what kind of water and electricity so it requires hundreds of megawatts of electricity just to run one trap India is yet not an electricity energy Surplus country we have we have regular power Cuts in summers where we say that uh uh okay industry will pay this higher price and there will also be power cuts that industry has to face because the residential consumers should get the power I and you should sit in AC so industries use their generators to generate their power they are given park at load shedding okay so uh one aspect availability of abundance of water second aspect we don't have we don't have water supply in our cities even Delhi there are areas where there is no no regular water supply we are the capital city here so there are many many reasons where our infrastructure is lacking okay so it is not just setting for so in India it is not just about establishing the facilities now also ensuring that you have the electricity made available to you you have water made available to you so the overall cost of establishing a Fab increases much more in India and as soon as that happens the products that you will make will be costlier than products that are made in tsmc or in a Samsung tab in Korea so why would anyone come to you so even if you make a Fab you will not be able to sell to anyone so if we use the same technology your cellular technology that is being used for teams tsmc or Samsung Japan company so in tsmc and Samsung these met electricity and water applied by the government over here this thing has to be ensured by the manufacturer himself because Supply heini I have to set up my captive power plants to be able to do this so that is extra cost in making the fabinal okay so it's a it should be uh combined effort by government as well as private sector yes it's all about economics so government is saying we are giving you those so much subsidy but the government is not realizing that the economics of a Fab is much much bigger than just setting up that habit is about ensuring that there is uninterrupted power supply uh that the labor is you know the labor laws are such that you're able to use the Fab uh 24 7 365 days a year and so on so there are many constraints because of which even though people have shown intent so as of now Tata group has shown and tend to participate in a semiconductor Saab but till now all these attempts have resulted out because it was a very costly Affair it's a very very high risk and the Indian government is not willing to take up the bill of that risk and why should it because if the profits come they will go to the private party then why should the loss come to the government the government is right and that's on towns but then should the government expand the semiconductor complex for example that we have in Mohali which is a government sub so these are you have you know tough questions to answer but yeah some answers would come from the bare economics of it that economics do not allow it to be done in India yet and you know uh also look at it like this you invest itna billion dollars to make a Fab how many jobs do you create for the government of India if they would invest that kind of money in the education sector or in uh in you know uh medium and Small industry sector they will be able to create much much more jobs so both sorry Dimensions it's not a simple answer so if you said designing and verification part is done in India a lot but eventually the fabrication is done outside so yes and because designing and verification does not require that kind of an infrastructure no it requires machines CPUs you can purchase even there there are lots of constraints you go to any of these companies and you talk to the finance people the asset managers they will just pull their hair something that you know uskandarvi government has such constraints today that uh even that is a difficult thing to do but okay because of people like you who are good who will turn out to be good designers companies still want to set up shop in India okay otherwise yeah sir I have seen uh course like post silicon validation Engineers what do they do I do not know what do they do how do they participate in this flow post siliconers after silicon is ready so what do you need to do you need to test to the new test so testing can be done you just bring a testing machine to India and you bring the Wafers and you can test here I know so testing is done in India more than that you can test and then you can debug okay by using stuff like best by using stuff like scan chains built-in self characterizers you can identify where the failure is and then you can help make the next version of the design better so that is post post silicon validation so I thought the these all uh distance can change were uh already tested while we were designing and performing every verification yeah but that is still pretty silicon now silicon suppose silicon validation is that okay I wanted this functionality so let us say like this uh I make a setup box chip yeah I get the Silicon now I have to ensure that the Silicon is able to run the entire suit of programs whether it is Netflix or whether it is uh ZTV or whether it is a simple cable TV relay whether it is an app or whether it is a simple cable TV relay and it should be secure there are so many functionalities linked to silica to this piece of silicon that I have just fabricated is it not that needs to be validated you do not even need a tester to do that you you use the tester you got the product out now that you have the product in hand which is seemingly all correct we need to validate that all the functionality that I wanted it to have does it have it yes sir is my software properly correlated with the hardware that I have manufactured yet so all that is part of poor silicon validation got it okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2JBCrDmuno,"Link:

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,SMA5k1yLOKs,okay so that was primarily the first introduction to vlsi section that we actually covered uh till the last class uh today we will move into vlsi devices okay so when i say the rsi devices what do you understand by vlsi devices the transistors okay just transistors capacitors and all those things for the mixed signal design yes not just transistors any actually we will start with mass capacitance over here okay so what is the mos capacitance what does mos stand for metal oxide semiconductor so what we are essentially saying three layers like is layer is method second outside and third is something yeah what we are saying is there is a metal there is a semiconductor and in between them there is an oxide so metal is simply a conducting plate a semiconductor is semiconducting but semiconducting means it can conduct so it is it means that there is a dielectric oxide between two conducting plates and that clearly means it's a capacitance so mass by the name itself represents the capacitance so metal the metal gate silicon dioxide and then the body and this becomes the mos capacitor when you put in the source and drain region you call it a mos transistor but we will initially start our analysis of from the mos capacitor we will move to mos transistors in the next step is that okay so uh when i say that this is metal oxide and silicon they're connected with each other what happens at these connections at this interface or at this interface any ideas you can read the question i am saying that when we bring metal oxide and semiconductor together you know we brought them they brought them together we brought them in contact with each other so when they come in contact with each other what happens at the interface so basically three of these materials have different uh electron affinities so uh when we bring them together so basically there has to be some rearrangement of charges that that has to happen there for this device on the material that we are overall creating to be stable to have a uniform potential across if we are not applying any potential so basically the band bending happens here energy so all of you understand what is electron affinity but then we use the term electron affinity there what is electron affinity [Music] outer motion yes the energy required for an electron to escape from any material that is called electron affinity so i would not say valence band because for example metals also have electron affinity so they don't have a valence band though but electron affinity essentially means the energy it takes to for an electron to escape from that particular material so every material has some electron affinity uh do you remember this much so so don't we call that a work function the yeah work function and that is also referred to as electron affinity okay okay yes there we are even fermi energy don't worry oh yeah yes actually in my pre-tech i have started affinity and what function is different terms like affinity uh like affinity is from uh like one is from five level and one is to take an electron from conduction like we have uh we have done as a work function is sum of affinity plus one more time like in the predictive study in this manner okay um let me check that and let me correct that for you like i will come back on this point a little later but uh do you understand that there would be some energy that every electron like that electrons in any material would require to move to the vacuum to escape from the from the substance yes sir so the vacuum level or universe level let us say is constant and energy required by different devices by different materials would be different so if it comes to plotting those materials so if let us say this is a vacuum level one material could be here another could be here another could be here can that happen yes sir and then when we bring these materials together what needs to match so first so okay again i'm slightly confused we're talking about all this electron affinity fermi level everything uh i do understand that some of you have like some of you did mention to me that in the last semester you did not cover semiconductor devices or mosfets in much detail so are these things coming like clear to you also because you studied them in your class 11 12 or in another course or is it all going over your head if you don't see that i think you understand this much just yeah sorry uh yeah so like um we understand this much it's just that we didn't cover all the frequency responses and the other various types of capacitance capacitances in a cmos um like what i mean in the mosfet so like uh yeah that's so so that pattern i have covered because that is what i intend to cover today right so we didn't cover device physics yeah so see i don't want to enter into too much of device physics also because there is a separate course solid state devices for that this course is not that but i i do want you to understand that there will be there are bands and there is band bending and there is a complete uh you know language two semiconductor devices so this jargon is not entirely clear this is not entirely it's not entirely clear it's not entirely clear so most of the jargon you will get clarified when you do the ssd codes and but i i want you to realize that there is some jargon around like that is that much clearer yes sir so there will be when you go when you go and do the ssd course you will talk about band diagrams and band bending and and all that stuff uh so if you are interested in device physics that is where that that is one course that you should definitely do in this course we are more into circuits but to understand circuits and their operation it is important to know that there is a physics behind it i don't want to go into too much of physics here but i want you to realize that there is a physical basis to whatever we are going to talk about from now on is that much clearer yes sir you have,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMA5k1yLOKs,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMA5k1yLOKs
Transcript: okay so that was primarily the first introduction to vlsi section that we actually covered uh till the last class uh today we will move into vlsi devices okay so when i say the rsi devices what do you understand by vlsi devices the transistors okay just transistors capacitors and all those things for the mixed signal design yes not just transistors any actually we will start with mass capacitance over here okay so what is the mos capacitance what does mos stand for metal oxide semiconductor so what we are essentially saying three layers like is layer is method second outside and third is something yeah what we are saying is there is a metal there is a semiconductor and in between them there is an oxide so metal is simply a conducting plate a semiconductor is semiconducting but semiconducting means it can conduct so it is it means that there is a dielectric oxide between two conducting plates and that clearly means it's a capacitance so mass by the name itself represents the capacitance so metal the metal gate silicon dioxide and then the body and this becomes the mos capacitor when you put in the source and drain region you call it a mos transistor but we will initially start our analysis of from the mos capacitor we will move to mos transistors in the next step is that okay so uh when i say that this is metal oxide and silicon they're connected with each other what happens at these connections at this interface or at this interface any ideas you can read the question i am saying that when we bring metal oxide and semiconductor together you know we brought them they brought them together we brought them in contact with each other so when they come in contact with each other what happens at the interface so basically three of these materials have different uh electron affinities so uh when we bring them together so basically there has to be some rearrangement of charges that that has to happen there for this device on the material that we are overall creating to be stable to have a uniform potential across if we are not applying any potential so basically the band bending happens here energy so all of you understand what is electron affinity but then we use the term electron affinity there what is electron affinity [Music] outer motion yes the energy required for an electron to escape from any material that is called electron affinity so i would not say valence band because for example metals also have electron affinity so they don't have a valence band though but electron affinity essentially means the energy it takes to for an electron to escape from that particular material so every material has some electron affinity uh do you remember this much so so don't we call that a work function the yeah work function and that is also referred to as electron affinity okay okay yes there we are even fermi energy don't worry oh yeah yes actually in my pre-tech i have started affinity and what function is different terms like affinity uh like affinity is from uh like one is from five level and one is to take an electron from conduction like we have uh we have done as a work function is sum of affinity plus one more time like in the predictive study in this manner okay um let me check that and let me correct that for you like i will come back on this point a little later but uh do you understand that there would be some energy that every electron like that electrons in any material would require to move to the vacuum to escape from the from the substance yes sir so the vacuum level or universe level let us say is constant and energy required by different devices by different materials would be different so if it comes to plotting those materials so if let us say this is a vacuum level one material could be here another could be here another could be here can that happen yes sir and then when we bring these materials together what needs to match so first so okay again i'm slightly confused we're

devices or mosfets in much detail so are these things coming like clear to you also because you studied them in your class 11 12 or in another course or is it all going over your head if you don't see that i think you understand this much just yeah sorry uh yeah so like um we understand this much it's just that we didn't cover all the frequency responses and the other various types of capacitance capacitances in a cmos um like what i mean in the mosfet so like uh yeah that's so so that pattern i have covered because that is what i intend to cover today right so we didn't cover device physics yeah so see i don't want to enter into too much of device physics also because there is a separate course solid state devices for that this course is not that but i i do want you to understand that there will be there are bands and there is band bending and there is a complete uh you know language two semiconductor devices so this jargon is not entirely clear this is not entirely it's not entirely clear it's not entirely clear so most of the jargon you will get clarified when you do the ssd codes and but i i want you to realize that there is some jargon around like that is that much clearer yes sir so there will be when you go when you go and do the ssd course you will talk about band diagrams and band bending and and all that stuff uh so if you are interested in device physics that is where that that is one course that you should definitely do in this course we are more into circuits but to understand circuits and their operation it is important to know that there is a physics behind it i don't want to go into too much of physics here but i want you to realize that there is a physical basis to whatever we are going to talk about from now on is that much clearer yes sir you have"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,cXY4b9XCUgM,foreign capacitances and mosfets earlier so that makes my job easier I can move I can actually move a little faster I will not go into too much of detail there then because I just wanted to have you have you get a glimpse of it and if you already have some Glimpse then I can be fast so what we are saying is that when these three materials come together they form a they form a capacitor between them but this capacitor is not like a capacitor between two metals see when you have two metal con two conducting layers there are some different characteristics that this capacitor would have in comparison to a metal oxide or metal dielectric metal capacitor and the reason for that is that uh there are these uh bands and that there are these energy levels that you're talking about and when we bring these semiconductors in contact with the oxide and we say that there is this Fermi level which needs to be matched across the entire material uh then it requires some band bending to happen we will just look at what band bending also means so uh over here what I have done is I've put a n Plus polysilicon a p silicon body and siot that is your silicon dioxide and when I bring these three materials together see n Plus n plus polysilicon means n plus means that there is so much doping that the Fermi level and the conduction band are kind of overlapping that is the kind of doping we have there okay sir could you elaborate on what family Fermi level is okay so Fermi level is a is a notional term it's actually it is a term which states that uh around 50 percent of the you know the probability of finding electrons in a particular material is is plotted and then it is said that uh there are 50 percent of electrons above the Fermi level and fifty percent of electrons below the Fermi level okay so Fermi level is such that uh okay the level itself it describes the energy of the electrons right yes it is about some energy of electrons but for example look at the Silicon silicon part of it the Silicon body part of it um over here the family level is in the band Gap what does that mean okay okay level actually there is no electron there over here look at it in the oxide region again the Fermi level is in the band app what that means is in within the uh oxide you're not expecting any electrons there Fermi level is just that probability what is the probability yeah so for me was a scientist who gave these this for me direct statistics okay to to uh describe the distribution of electrons in a semiconductor okay okay and uh so that is classical physics um in an Advanced Technologies are are today we also use quantum Quantum devices and quantum physics into it so some of these things may hold true some of these things may not fall true but Fermi level you say is a notional level at which the probability of finding an electron is 50 percent so what what is the meaning of primary level lying inside a band Gap it simply means when when this line is closer to the valence band it means that is a p-type doped substance so the probability of finding electrons in the balance band is higher when it is closer to the conduction band it means it's the n-type doc substance or probability of finding an electron in the valence band is higher and when it is in the center that is along with the intrinsic level so intrinsic level is in the center of the band Gap sure it means that uh the material is not doped okay okay so Fermi level has no physical significance it has only a notional thing created to improve our understanding and to do some analysis of the system physically it represents no energy level is that clear yes sir okay so what happens is that when I bring these three materials next to each other then uh the Fermi level has to be aligned because in this region we say that the probability of finding an electron above the Fermi level is 50 percent and below it is also 50 percent now we also understand that silicon say polysilicon over here and sio2 have a Affinity difference of 3.1 electron volts okay and over here also there is a gap of 3.1 electron volts because this side is also silicon but because the Fermi level is stable so at at an infinite depth we would we would get the same uh Fermi level as the doping or the Fermi level at the same level as a doping but close to this oxide boundary what happens is there starts to be some collection of charge or removal of charge so that I can get this 3.1 electron volt dap between oxide and the conduction band of the semiconductor this is called as band bending and this is what changes the behavior of a mass capacitor from a regular capacitor that you would otherwise see in your Labs you may have already seen in your earlier labs and the the capacitors the metal capacitors are stuff like that that you would otherwise use Mass capacitors behave would behave differently from them is this part clear that at least this much that most most capacitors will not be like any other capacitor they will behave differently this part here yeah so okay so as well you have a question so can you please explain that again uh I was not able to understand like flaw like from this when you have said 3.1 electron volts in the gate side and 3.1 in the silicon and that is what is bending like can you please explain that role part again Okay so let us say the three materials are separately placed as of now let us say okay uh yeah let us say three materials are separately are placed separately as of now and uh when they are separate separated when they are separate we realize that conduction band of polysilicon conduction band of silicon and conduction band of the dielectric they will have a gap of 3.1 electron volt between them is it clear till here yes sir now because of the doping Fermi level of this was here um level was at the EC that is how we had doped because you wanted it to be like a metal yes metal means a sea of electrons lots of electrons there so you dope it very heavily so heavily that it was almost like EC and efr coinciding you will always have electrons in the conduction and that is when it becomes a metal otherwise it will not be a metal yes sir so you dope it very heavily so the Fermi level and this match now you bring these two materials together what happens as soon as these materials start to touch each other a requirement section that Fermi levels have to be matched okay so Fermi levels have to be matched what does this mean it means that this material there will be some voltage generated internally so that Fermi level will match all of this will go up all of this will go up so that the Fermi level matches and your valence band is here and conduction band is up there but there is also this free condition but there is also this precondition that spacing between these two will be 3.1 volts so what happens if this went up by let us say x volts a data X you know extra question part will appear across the dielectric dielectric can always have a voltage drop across it see Metals cannot have voltage drop across them do you understand this if there is any voltage drop across a metal electrons will flow and kind of mitigate that voltage drop but dielectrics and semiconductors can have some voltage drop across them because they don't allow flow of electrons easily yes so the dielectric over here will bend and this is a semiconductor so a semiconductor can also bend a bit so the semiconductor also backs combined this bending plus this bending we would get we would get this movement of the Fermi level from uh wherever it was to the metal Fermi level okay okay so bending that happened here the line is not coming yeah so the bending that happened across the oxide and the bending that happened across the uh uh semiconductor side I'd add the addition of that will be equal to EC minus EF on the semiconductor side yes sir okay okay and it is because of this band bending that your device that your capacitance Behavior do you understand this is the capacitor but this capacitor Behavior will be different from a regular metal oxide metal capacitor okay so okay okay and it is much more clear yes thank you great rajnish you have a question yeah sir uh sir as you said that uh between the uh the conduction bands of the uh poly and the sio2 uh the energy gap must be 3.1 electron sir uh so a and in this side between the uh this substrate and the Silicon oxide uh uh do uh it is a starting behaving like n type that's why we have to maintain 3.1 electron over here also no no no 3.1 electron voltage required because that is the barrier for any electron to move from Silicon to silicon dioxide okay so for any electron to move from Silicon to silicon dioxide you would need 3.1 electron volts so you cannot change that happens okay and there is no bending on the metal side because metal is a sea of electrons yes yes thank you okay I have to add some more things like if someone asks why band binding is happening so we have to save for matching the Fermi level band bending is happening is that right so when you explain the way like I explained it to you when when things are in contact with each other their family levels have to match okay but there is a physical uh barrier also which exists there's this electrical barrier which cannot be changed so this 3.1 electron volt also has to be maintained okay so for the because of these Spirits because of these two things that band bending happens okay okay thank you sir okay not just one of them both of them are involved yes sir okay that's nice so can I ask yes so uh as I understand the gate and the Silicon body there are different materials so but why we're meeting the 3.1 electron volt for both both of them because we use poly silicon for the gate now polysilicon is polycrystalline silicon okay so that's why it's three point one same thing okay yes so uh okay and it's a very good question rather because we need to understand that in Advanced Technologies we're using metal gates so what happens when I use a metal gate this 3.1 electron volt is not necessary now I can have a different uh I can have a different uh pinning point so till the time we were using polysilicon Gates there was a constraint on what the VT of different devices can be because you can only dope as much and this is only bending that you can bring about okay whereas uh once we start to use metal gates and hierarchy dielectrics uh what happens is that I have more flexibility by changing the material of the gate to change my VT of the pmos and the nmos independently okay so this is something that you should remember this would come in handy in some interview sometime you had a question yes sir sir talking about this silicon body where the bending is actually happening at the interface of the oxide and the Silicon bodies and there I can see that Fermi level has moved towards more towards the conduction band so can I say that electron concentration has also changed it is more towards uh interface rather than the bulk yes uh interface Matlab sorry uh interface okay so what we say is that at the surface of uh the device at the surface of or at the interface of silicon dioxide and uh uh p-type silicon body there is a higher density of electrons than in the remaining part of the body that is what you can say yes okay so ah we have to be very exact in the way we speak things over here because a slip of one word or another can can completely change the meaning sir sir in case of n silicon body uh this uh EVS of the Silicon oxide and uh this substrate have to be uh difference must be constant now yeah so it is a so if we had a n-type silicon body the band bending would be in a different direction then okay uh yes sorry yes sir actually I was confused like uh like I think poorly Krishna should be the like good materials and get as a that's good great material because like like poly silicone and silicone will have very less work function difference so it will keep the threshold voltage low actually as per my knowledge as as much I know can you please explain that so uh we we used polysilicon as the date material because it was very easy and cheap to manufacture using Metals makes the process much more complex and polysilicon and plus policy again and P plus policy can also helps in controlling the VT the band bending initially so that also helps so sir like can you please tell like other advantages of using matter so like so let us say let us say neither SSD is the right course to discuss this in detail because then we are talking about design of the devices I want to talk about the fact that capacitance in a mosfet will behave differently from the capacitance a regular capacitance that you have known till now we are digressing too much but yeah if you want we can discuss it in the office that's not a problem thank you sir okay David uses so along the width of the uh sio2 we see that EC and EV is kind of rising linearly so why is that happening because uh yeah sio2 what happens is there is no electron that can happen and between in nsio2 am I right yes sir it's a dielectric so what happens uh since there is no charge um the entire voltage drop across the or the voltage drop across this silicon dioxide thickness is distributed equitably across the entire back side in Silicon there will be some charges that will still be there fore you have a bend a kind of a curve there because some potential drop happens there so so can we say that the extent of the band bending would depend upon the thickness of the silicon dioxide as well because if we increase this means from the diagram if we increase the silicon dioxide width it will it would rise more linearly thus resisting more voltage drop and no no no so what happens is the slope of this will change the the distribution of band bending across silicon dioxide and the p-type Silicon is is actually a function of the dielectric constants of silicon and silicon dioxide not a function of thickness so the drop across silicon dioxide will be in the ratio of the dielectric constants of silicon dioxide and silicon okay then the slope will be lesser okay if it is thinner the slope will be much deeper and that can lead to tunneling we will look at that later in the past so in one more small questions sorry if we replace the dielectric materials uh by let's say that is having a say higher dielectric value so then the band bending would decrease the type of band bending would also change yes because it is a function of dielectric constant very good this is a very good introduction very good and that's why you told us state that for reducing variability we are using uh thicker dielectric and replacing them with uh no the reason of using hierarchy dialectics was not to be able to do this this is the additional benefit see it's a very costly Affair to use high k dielectrics for silicon dioxide you simply growth oxide that's it to deposit a high K die electrode electric you actually have to do atomic level layer deposition it's a slow process it takes time and it's complex you have you have to talk about rare earth materials and uh rare earth metals and you know 99.9 percent of rare earth metals are sourced from China so it's a it's a big risk the whole electronic industry electronic industry actually uh pivots around geopolitics of China okay so uh we don't want to use high K dialectics just for the fun of it so high grade dialectics were introduced because if you would not use that then uh the silicon dioxide would need to be drawn so thin like you would just need say five angstroms of silicon dioxide that uh huge current would flow from through the gate leakage okay tunneling across the gate so many things would happen so you could not afford that so if you want to scale you you cannot go to that thin a physical that's in physical dialectic there so you go to High K dielectric so that the physical thickness is more okay so it also reduces variability because the physical thickness physical Dimension has increased so variability also reduces naturally yes you understood yes okay yes yeah so aniraj if you have if you have no more question you can lower your hand it makes it easier for me raghav so in this silicon body uh when we are measuring this uh work first 3.1 electrons we are referring to the very at the interface level from the interface why is that actually I'm not able to get because it is summoned from the interface only that an electron can jump across the barrier to be able to jump from say silicon into silicon dioxide so silicon dioxide has this conduction band this is the conduction band of silicon dioxide up there this one what is happening my PowerPoint me seems to have got stuck not able to move into bar point so I may need to restart that but yeah uh the top point you know the top line which has a slant over there this represents uh silicon the conduction band of silicon dioxide so if an electron has to move from Silicon to the conduction band of silicon dioxide it has to have that kind of 3.1 electron volts with it that movement will happen only when the when the two substances are touching each other it cannot happen at some other places so but that's that's that is the moment that is that we don't want right so that will not happen what about whether you want it or not the fact is that if the electron at the interface gets 3.1 electron volts it will jump into the conduction band of the dielectric that's a fact whether you want it or not doesn't matter okay so we are bending 3.1 is a physical phenomena which has to be intact Even in our model so band diagram is a model of this in this silicon oxide and metal is it not it is simply a model of what we are talking about the model has to reflect what is physically the constraint so physically there is a constraint that could jump from Silicon to silicon dioxide you need 3.1 electron volts that is where the model is made like this okay okay so yeah rajneesh so uh why we have a grounded VG here in this oh we just wanted to study something we grounded it so in reality you will have many things coming on the gate this is just one analysis we are doing no no other reason so on varying we did so all things will change yeah yeah yeah that is how you will turn the transistor on and turn it off now by changing the gate voltage I mean that's it we're not at the transistor yet but yes this is just one terminal of the capacitance so capacitance one terminal cannot need not necessarily be fixed both terminals can change you just put it to Brown so this band diagram will change yes yes yes yes okay sir uh you were actually talking about the relationship between these band diagram and vth right sir uh could you I'm like say that once there's nothing like threshold voltage for a moss capacitor you are saying something about a vth previously sir I mean yeah I was talking about that for uh for uh transistors that if the the band bending over here determines what is the threshold voltage that you would require we'll come to that in a little while we'll come to that when we will touch about the mosfets thank you okay or even earlier than that actually so those whose questions are answered please lower your hands uh yeah you said that because of this band bending the mosfet doesn't behave like regular capacitors right so uh how so how are we saying that exactly so uh see for a regular metal metal oxide metal capacitor uh the oxide thickness or the dielectric thickness remains constant is it not yeah yeah over here what is happening over here you realize that if I want to change the charges so so whatever you whatever voltages you apply on the two sides charges will change across the fixed thickness of the capacitor yeah but in a mosfet uh in a mosfet name Moss capacitor you see that there is some band bending happening okay if you add more charges somewhere the bending would change right right so you wanted some charges some charts charge distribution to appear but due to band bending that charge distribution is different from that so what does the uh level of the conduction band of your uh silicon dioxide has do anything with the capacitance because it defines where the electrons would come and settle right right so that is where see capacitance is about two plates and putting charges on those two plates so on the Silicon side how will the charges be placed and where they will be placed that will depend on the bands over there now okay okay yeah because bands Define where the charges can come and where they simply cannot come right and therefore band bending would mean that and variable band mending would mean that the capacitance would vary okay Priyanka so like in this at interface we have to maintain 3.1 electron mole uh like electron affinity so by in not in uh body like when we go from a file from the interface why this bending doesn't happen there like there also we have to maintain a 3.1 electron world no an electron from one one micron depths inside the semiconductor cannot simply jump into the dioxide now yeah to be able to move into the dioxide the electron has to first come close to the surface only then it will jump so this 3.1 is required only at the surface now look at the metal side on the metal side three point one electron voltage constant that is throughout the metal side this is 3.1 electron volts why so because in metals you cannot have any bending so it is all constant but in a semiconductor since you can't have bending uh the capacitance also varies and uh 3.1 electron volt or the you know Fermi level uh or basically at some depth the original nature of the semiconductor would appear and not the band bended one is that clear yes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXY4b9XCUgM,"Link:

Transcript: foreign capacitances and mosfets earlier so that makes my job easier I can move I can actually move a little faster I will not go into too much of detail there then because I just wanted to have you have you get a glimpse of it and if you already have some Glimpse then I can be fast so what we are saying is that when these three materials come together they form a they form a

has to be aligned because in this region we say that the probability of finding an electron above the Fermi level is 50 percent and below it is also 50 percent now we also understand that silicon say polysilicon over here and sio2 have a Affinity difference of 3.1 electron volts okay and over here also there is a gap of 3.1 electron volts because this side is also silicon but because the Fermi level is stable so at at an infinite depth we would we would get the same uh Fermi level as the doping or the Fermi level at the same level as a doping but close to this oxide boundary what happens is there starts to be some collection of charge or removal of charge so that I can get this 3.1 electron volt dap between oxide and the conduction band of the semiconductor this is called as band bending and this is what changes the behavior of a mass capacitor from a regular capacitor that you would otherwise see in your Labs you may have already seen in your earlier labs and the the capacitors the metal capacitors are stuff like that that you would otherwise use Mass capacitors behave would behave differently from them is this part clear that at least this much that most most capacitors will not be like any other capacitor they will behave differently this part here yeah so okay so as well you have a question so can you please explain that again uh I was not able to understand like flaw like from this when you have said 3.1 electron volts in the gate side and 3.1 in the silicon and that is what is bending like can you please explain that role part again Okay so let us say the three materials are separately placed as of now let us say okay uh yeah let us say three materials are separately are placed separately as of now and uh when they are separate separated when they are separate we realize that conduction band of polysilicon conduction band of silicon and conduction band of the dielectric they will have a gap of 3.1 electron volt between them is it clear till here yes sir now because of the doping Fermi level of this was here um level was at the EC that is how we had doped because you wanted it to be like a metal yes metal means a sea of electrons lots of electrons there so you dope it very heavily so heavily that it was almost like EC and efr coinciding you will always have electrons in the conduction and that is when it becomes a metal otherwise it will not be a metal yes sir so you dope it very heavily so the Fermi level and this match now you bring these two materials together what happens as soon as these materials start to touch each other a requirement section that Fermi levels have to be matched okay so Fermi levels have to be matched what does this mean it means that this material there will be some voltage generated internally so that Fermi level will match all of this will go up all of this will go up so that the Fermi level matches and your valence band is here and conduction band is up there but there is also this free condition but there is also this precondition that spacing between these two will be 3.1 volts so what happens if this went up by let us say x volts a data X you know extra question part will appear across the dielectric dielectric can always have a voltage drop across it see Metals cannot have voltage drop across them do you understand this if there is any voltage drop across a metal electrons will flow and kind of mitigate that voltage drop but dielectrics and semiconductors can have some voltage drop across them because they don't allow flow of electrons easily yes so the dielectric over here will bend and this is a semiconductor so a semiconductor can also bend a bit so the semiconductor also backs combined this bending plus this bending we would get we would get this movement of the Fermi level from uh wherever it was to the metal Fermi level okay okay so bending that happened here the line is not coming yeah so the bending that happened across the oxide and the bending that happened across the uh uh semiconductor side I'd add the addition of that will be equal to EC minus EF on the semiconductor side yes sir okay okay and it is because of this band bending that your device that your capacitance Behavior do you understand this is the capacitor but this capacitor Behavior will be different from a regular metal oxide metal capacitor okay so okay okay and it is much more clear yes thank you great rajnish you have a question yeah sir uh sir as you said that uh between the uh the conduction bands of the uh poly and the sio2 uh the energy gap must be 3.1 electron sir uh so a and in this side between the uh this substrate and the Silicon oxide uh uh do uh it is a starting behaving like n type that's why we have to maintain 3.1 electron over here also no no no 3.1 electron voltage required because that is the barrier for any electron to move from Silicon to silicon dioxide okay so for any electron to move from Silicon to silicon dioxide you would need 3.1 electron volts so you cannot change that happens okay and there is no bending on the metal side because metal is a sea of electrons yes yes thank you okay I have to add some more things like if someone asks why band binding is happening so we have to save for matching the Fermi level band bending is happening is that right so when you explain the way like I explained it to you when when things are in contact with each other their family levels have to match okay but there is a physical uh barrier also which exists there's this electrical barrier which cannot be changed so this 3.1 electron volt also has to be maintained okay so for the because of these Spirits because of these two things that band bending happens okay okay thank you sir okay not just one of them both of them are involved yes sir okay that's nice so can I ask yes so uh as I understand the gate and the Silicon body there are different materials so but why we're meeting the 3.1 electron volt for both both of them because we use poly silicon for the gate now polysilicon is polycrystalline silicon okay so that's why it's three point one same thing okay yes so uh okay and it's a very good question rather because we need to understand that in Advanced Technologies we're using metal gates so what happens when I use a metal gate this 3.1 electron volt is not necessary now I can have a different uh I can have a different uh pinning point so till the time we were using polysilicon Gates there was a constraint on what the VT of different devices can be because you can only dope as much and this is only bending that you can bring about okay whereas uh once we start to use metal gates and hierarchy dielectrics uh what happens is that I have more flexibility by changing the material of the gate to change my VT of the pmos and the nmos independently okay so this is something that you should remember this would come in handy in some interview sometime you had a question yes sir sir talking about this silicon body where the bending is actually happening at the interface of the oxide and the Silicon bodies and there I can see that Fermi level has moved towards more towards the conduction band so can I say that electron concentration has also changed it is more towards uh interface rather than the bulk yes uh interface Matlab sorry uh interface okay so what we say is that at the surface of uh the device at the surface of or at the interface of silicon dioxide and uh uh p-type silicon body there is a higher density of electrons than in the remaining part of the body that is what you can say yes okay so ah we have to be very exact in the way we speak things over here because a slip of one word or another can can completely change the meaning sir sir in case of n silicon body uh this uh EVS of the Silicon oxide and uh this substrate have to be uh difference must be constant now yeah so it is a so if we had a n-type silicon body the band bending would be in a different direction then okay uh yes sorry yes sir actually I was confused like uh like I think poorly Krishna should be the like good materials and get as a that's good great material because like like poly silicone and silicone will have very less work function difference so it will keep the threshold voltage low actually as per my knowledge as as much I know can you please explain that so uh we we used polysilicon as the date material because it was very easy and cheap to manufacture using Metals makes the process much more complex and polysilicon and plus policy again and P plus policy can also helps in controlling the VT the band bending initially so that also helps so sir like can you please tell like other advantages of using matter so like so let us say let us say neither SSD is the right course to discuss this in detail because then we are talking about design of the devices I want to talk about the fact that capacitance in a mosfet will behave differently from the capacitance a regular capacitance that you have known till now we are digressing too much but yeah if you want we can discuss it in the office that's not a problem thank you sir okay David uses so along the width of the uh sio2 we see that EC and EV is kind of rising linearly so why is that happening because uh yeah sio2 what happens is there is no electron that can happen and between in nsio2 am I right yes sir it's a dielectric so what happens uh since there is no charge um the entire voltage drop across the or the voltage drop across this silicon dioxide thickness is distributed equitably across the entire back side in Silicon there will be some charges that will still be there fore you have a bend a kind of a curve there because some potential drop happens there so so can we say that the extent of the band bending would depend upon the thickness of the silicon dioxide as well because if we increase this means from the diagram if we increase the silicon dioxide width it will it would rise more linearly thus resisting more voltage drop and no no no so what happens is the slope of this will change the the distribution of band bending across silicon dioxide and the p-type Silicon is is actually a function of the dielectric constants of silicon and silicon dioxide not a function of thickness so the drop across silicon dioxide will be in the ratio of the dielectric constants of silicon dioxide and silicon okay then the slope will be lesser okay if it is thinner the slope will be much deeper and that can lead to tunneling we will look at that later in the past so in one more small questions sorry if we replace the dielectric materials uh by let's say that is having a say higher dielectric value so then the band bending would decrease the type of band bending would also change yes because it is a function of dielectric constant very good this is a very good introduction very good and that's why you told us state that for reducing variability we are using uh thicker dielectric and replacing them with uh no the reason of using hierarchy dialectics was not to be able to do this this is the additional benefit see it's a very costly Affair to use high k dielectrics for silicon dioxide you simply growth oxide that's it to deposit a high K die electrode electric you actually have to do atomic level layer deposition it's a slow process it takes time and it's complex you have you have to talk about rare earth materials and uh rare earth metals and you know 99.9 percent of rare earth metals are sourced from China so it's a it's a big risk the whole electronic industry electronic industry actually uh pivots around geopolitics of China okay so uh we don't want to use high K dialectics just for the fun of it so high grade dialectics were introduced because if you would not use that then uh the silicon dioxide would need to be drawn so thin like you would just need say five angstroms of silicon dioxide that uh huge current would flow from through the gate leakage okay tunneling across the gate so many things would happen so you could not afford that so if you want to scale you you cannot go to that thin a physical that's in physical dialectic there so you go to High K dielectric so that the physical thickness is more okay so it also reduces variability because the physical thickness physical Dimension has increased so variability also reduces naturally yes you understood yes okay yes yeah so aniraj if you have if you have no more question you can lower your hand it makes it easier for me raghav so in this silicon body uh when we are measuring this uh work first 3.1 electrons we are referring to the very at the interface level from the interface why is that actually I'm not able to get because it is summoned from the interface only that an electron can jump across the barrier to be able to jump from say silicon into silicon dioxide so silicon dioxide has this conduction band this is the conduction band of silicon dioxide up there this one what is happening my PowerPoint me seems to have got stuck not able to move into bar point so I may need to restart that but yeah uh the top point you know the top line which has a slant over there this represents uh silicon the conduction band of silicon dioxide so if an electron has to move from Silicon to the conduction band of silicon dioxide it has to have that kind of 3.1 electron volts with it that movement will happen only when the when the two substances are touching each other it cannot happen at some other places so but that's that's that is the moment that is that we don't want right so that will not happen what about whether you want it or not the fact is that if the electron at the interface gets 3.1 electron volts it will jump into the conduction band of the dielectric that's a fact whether you want it or not doesn't matter okay so we are bending 3.1 is a physical phenomena which has to be intact Even in our model so band diagram is a model of this in this silicon oxide and metal is it not it is simply a model of what we are talking about the model has to reflect what is physically the constraint so physically there is a constraint that could jump from Silicon to silicon dioxide you need 3.1 electron volts that is where the model is made like this okay okay so yeah rajneesh so uh why we have a grounded VG here in this oh we just wanted to study something we grounded it so in reality you will have many things coming on the gate this is just one analysis we are doing no no other reason so on varying we did so all things will change yeah yeah yeah that is how you will turn the transistor on and turn it off now by changing the gate voltage I mean that's it we're not at the transistor yet but yes this is just one terminal of the capacitance so capacitance one terminal cannot need not necessarily be fixed both terminals can change you just put it to Brown so this band diagram will change yes yes yes yes okay sir uh you were actually talking about the relationship between these band diagram and vth right sir uh could you I'm like say that once there's nothing like threshold voltage for a moss capacitor you are saying something about a vth previously sir I mean yeah I was talking about that for uh for uh transistors that if the the band bending over here determines what is the threshold voltage that you would require we'll come to that in a little while we'll come to that when we will touch about the mosfets thank you okay or even earlier than that actually so those whose questions are answered please lower your hands uh yeah you said that because of this band bending the mosfet doesn't behave like regular capacitors right so uh how so how are we saying that exactly so uh see for a regular metal metal oxide metal capacitor uh the oxide thickness or the dielectric thickness remains constant is it not yeah yeah over here what is happening over here you realize that if I want to change the charges so so whatever you whatever voltages you apply on the two sides charges will change across the fixed thickness of the capacitor yeah but in a mosfet uh in a mosfet name Moss capacitor you see that there is some band bending happening okay if you add more charges somewhere the bending would change right right so you wanted some charges some charts charge distribution to appear but due to band bending that charge distribution is different from that so what does the uh level of the conduction band of your uh silicon dioxide has do anything with the capacitance because it defines where the electrons would come and settle right right so that is where see capacitance is about two plates and putting charges on those two plates so on the Silicon side how will the charges be placed and where they will be placed that will depend on the bands over there now okay okay yeah because bands Define where the charges can come and where they simply cannot come right and therefore band bending would mean that and variable band mending would mean that the capacitance would vary okay Priyanka so like in this at interface we have to maintain 3.1 electron mole uh like electron affinity so by in not in uh body like when we go from a file from the interface why this bending doesn't happen there like there also we have to maintain a 3.1 electron world no an electron from one one micron depths inside the semiconductor cannot simply jump into the dioxide now yeah to be able to move into the dioxide the electron has to first come close to the surface only then it will jump so this 3.1 is required only at the surface now look at the metal side on the metal side three point one electron voltage constant that is throughout the metal side this is 3.1 electron volts why so because in metals you cannot have any bending so it is all constant but in a semiconductor since you can't have bending uh the capacitance also varies and uh 3.1 electron volt or the you know Fermi level uh or basically at some depth the original nature of the semiconductor would appear and not the band bended one is that clear yes"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,CMe2mvwtX2M,so i will need to stop the recording over here for a minute uh because my okay so uh we just earlier talked about the fact here you have a question your hand is raised oh no sorry sir so uh we were just talking about the fact that due to band bending in the semiconductor region the mosfet capacitor would behave different the mos capacitor would behave differently than a metal capacitor a metal oxide metal capacitor so to be able to characterize this what we do is we apply a voltage between substrate and the gate and we say that we will vary this voltage v and we want to observe the you know the change in charge and the change in capacitance or the flow of current that is happening to measure the capacitance there okay and you see what happens over time when i apply a negative voltage on the gate what would happen when i apply a negative voltage on the gate though this is a p times substrate more holes would accumulate at the surface of silicon are you able to see this yes yes sir huh yes so this part is called accumulation now when i say that i reduce that negative voltage i bring the voltage closer to zero then what happens then we we looked at uh this band bending diagram and this voltage at both the nodes was zero so uh i would have this kind of a band bending happening there so if you look at it carefully what we are talking about it is that at the surface of of the silicon over here my es is kind of coinciding with the fermi level so what i would say is that there is some so when it is at the fermi level what does that mean that the silicon behavior in this region would be something like intrinsic silicon are you able to see this so if e s is equal to e i we call it as intrinsic silicon that nothing is doped there is no doping am i right yes over here if you look at it carefully uh see e i would be something like this over here in the center of ef and ec ef and economy easy and easy so yeah it's the band of silicon right no ei is the intrinsic energy level which is in the center of easy and easy intrinsic energy okay ei the red one that i am showing that's called ei okay okay so over here we see that e i and e f are almost coinciding due to band bending so i have intrinsic silicon so i would say things are almost depleted there okay and what happens is that in this region node if i if i change the voltage by a small value of few millivolts here and there there will be no charge change over here at the surface the charge would change at the boundary of this depletion layer there will be slightly extra bending or slightly lesser bending okay because at the surface it is almost intrinsic now any change any more charge or any less charge the change would happen at the boundary of the depletion rate uh so so just just to like clarify so uh can you go back to the previous slide this one uh uh no no okay i meant that uh yeah this one so here near the surface of i mean near the boundary of um your your silicon and your silicon dioxide your intrinsic energy level is coinciding with the fermi level so there it behaves like intrinsic silicon so there's not much accumulation over there but uh when you go away from the boundary it uh it approaches the conduction uh yeah you start to get more charges so so that there it behaves more like an n-type that's b-type over here it's e-type yeah but sir if it's uh if your intrinsic level is closer to the conduction band the intrinsic level is always in the center okay so when the band's been intrinsic level also is shown to be bending it is also a notional level right so um yeah so there if it's like regular p-type then why do we see a depletion region over there depletion means there are no uh like if you need charges more charges there are not many charges available here because it's almost intrinsic oh okay okay so like relatively it's uh relative and compared to the other one it's like end time even though it's just intrinsic silicon yeah okay right okay so what happens because there are no charges in this region any charges you need you will get them from the remaining depth of the silicon okay so any change in charge density would happen at the boundary of my bending so my effective ox dielectric thickness see when we say that my dielectric there are these two metal one metal two and there is this dielectric in between we say that the capacitance is equal to epsilon uh by a let us say okay epsilon into uh like epsilon a by d ox i know as t ox reduces your capacitance increases okay so what are we saying over here we are saying that my t-ox we are saying that this is my capacitor because i change a small voltage over here there is a small change in capacitance right after t ox but in silicon we are saying that that change in charge happens at t ox plus w d so what happens the denominator becomes t ox plus wd what does that mean that my capacitance would reduce right right okay okay now effectively a capacitor with with in series with another yeah i know then uh if i do still more apply still more voltage over there then there will be still more band bending still more band bending would mean let us say this and this would mean that i had a p-type but in this region i have an n-type material now because my fermi level is very close to the conduction band because of so high band bending okay so this is called as inversion layer and now if i want to change any charge there is so many so many charged particles available over here all that movement of charge can happen from the inversion layer itself so again my oxide thickness comes out to be t-ox okay so when you increase the voltage over here like this you see that initially the capacitance is high why is it high it is high because the change in charge is happening across the oxide only this is the accumulation region after some time we see that oh this capacitance starts to decrease why does it start to decrease because this depletion layer starts to get formed and this depletion layer means there are no float no available charges there so that the any change in charge would happen at the boundary of the depletion layer but all of a sudden what happens an inversion layer is formed and additional change of charge happens at the surface of or at the interface of silicon and silicon dioxide again so this is the low frequency transfer characteristic or characteristic of the mass capacitor now why did i say low frequency so maybe because at low frequency only that interface would be changing at higher frequencies so it will remain at low frequency what happens is at low frequency what happens is my let us say this is the band bending thing happening there so at low frequencies what happens is i have sufficient time to move electrons from here to substrate sufficient time to do that and therefore any change in electron density would happen at this interface at very high frequency what happens is uh if i'm moving very very very very fast so what happens is electron starts to go out but it has not even crossed the depletion region when the polarity has changed so the electrons of this region remain here only so where does any change in electrons happen it happens at the depletion width boundary again and therefore at very high frequencies the mass capacitance will behave as a very less capacitance sir yes sir could you explain this inversion layer again sir inversion layer what do you understand by inversion layer till now sir uh i'm like what i understood is that uh there is a another layer which is being formed in between like depletion and this layer so see we had a p-type silicon am i right yes sir now due to band bending the surface of the silicon has more density of electrons now yes so that at the surface it has now become n-type okay sir yes sir yes that is why it is called inversion because the polarity of the material we had we had physically of p-type material but at the surface we now have a n-type material okay that is why it is called inversion layer uh sir i mean even in depletion region also we we do have this electrons right sir first suppose uh no you do not have that kind of a density of electrons as you would have in an n type material depletion region actually has all is kind of depleted of any moving moving carriers that is why it is called depletion region okay i'm like due to this high voltage or something we are getting free electrons in that region yes okay sir thank you sir because so much band bending has happened electrons can very easily come there here rajneesh [Music] so ei is always designed or always shown as bit as the center of band gap it is a constant value e i is a notional number or a notional energy level where no electron can exist can sit there but it is shown as the center of the band gap it is an energy level which is equidistant from the valence band and the conduction band both ef on the other hand is derived from fermi direct statistics which says that probability of electrons above this is 50 and below this is also 50 percent ef is also a national energy level yes it is also a notional energy level however es will be different uh years will be closer to the conduction band in n-type material and valence band in p-type material e i will always be equidistant from both okay yes fashionable sir uh yes sir actually when this inversion layer form sir uh are the depletion electrons even present so i mean like below them depletion has no moving carriers yes sir i'm i was asking only about the layers here not the electrons or the carriers is that present over there depletion layer is always there there are there are some there are silicon atoms there yes sir i mean so there is there is a flood of electrons also there therefore we call it electro uh inversion layer so where are these electrons actually moving from sorry i mean like our voltage is being given between the gate and the body to be precise uh right sir so uh where are these electrons exactly moving sir so if the depletion region is in between uh gate and body and over there if the oh over that if the inversion line is being formed then uh i don't see any uh charge transfer or something or the current transfer between the gate and the body the gate and the body do not have any charge transfer capacitor does not allow charge to move from gate to the from one terminal to the other it cannot happen can it there is a silicon dioxide barrier in between nothing would ever move from gate to the body okay that is why we have silicon dioxide is it not that is the meaning of a capacitor but the two plates are not physically connected but they are influencing each of those behavior so what is happening i change something on the gate the behavior on the silicon side changes that is what a capacitance is okay sir we are only talking about the capacitance value that's it uh not about any uh current flow or something yeah thank you sir so so this high frequency model so i couldn't get it so this yeah so the high frequency model rather is about uh the fact that see it takes some picoseconds even if it is picoseconds for an electron to move out from the inversion layer to the substrate to the body henna now if i'm operating at a small signal level which is say 20 gigahertz how much time do i have just a few picoseconds the electron may not be able to physically move out from the inversion layer to the body but some voltage change is happening so some charge change is happening somewhere it cannot happen if it is not happening in the inversion layer it can only happen at the boundary of the depletion layer so like when i've crossed the vt voltage i have my inversion layer form so now i can see a effective capacitance thickness of t-ox now if i increase beyond vt now but still i will have that inversion layer right so so i mean i can understand that why that uh like i should go up like that because uh even if i'm fasting changing and changing very fast even the very frequency is very fast but still that inversion there exists so the t-ox is constant so what additional charge what is the capacitance we discussed that a little while back the capacitance is about or the thickness of oxide or whatever we talk about is about there is one plate there is another plate i change something here something changes on this plate that is the effect of spacing between the two plates is it not now there is this television layer here fine but nothing is changing there because there is no time for it to change only change is happening here only at the edge of the depletion boundary so this is my effective capacitance okay so inversion inversion liquid capacitance will be there but additional to that at the depletion end also no inver at very high frequency inversion layer does not have any influence on capacitance because it cannot change any charges the charges in the inversion layer cannot change yes in response to the change in gate voltage okay answer but still why it is getting constant then after that at the high frequency model shouldn't be some kind of depletion depletion width cannot grow beyond a particular maximum level any further voltage you apply there will be more charges in the in the inversion layer depletion widths cannot go beyond that okay so after the high frequency model the change the the changes in charge the delta q is happening at the very uh at the wd max depletion rate okay okay so it becomes this inversion becomes a constant basically okay sir yes i'm sorry so yeah i had this uh i had a question regarding depletion there only so like uh when we are going from um you know your depletion region to your inversion region so like it's accumulation of like effectively free electrons is just happening on the boundary right but as it happens so somewhere between the inversion layer to your body there has to be a depletion there right so the depletion layer so the depletion layer would always be there but at low frequency the charges in the electro and the inversion layer can change okay therefore the effective capacitance that you see increases because the t-ox changes or the effective distance between the two plates their charges are changing reduces right right okay sir yes sir uh my doubt was the same i'm like that this is an addition to the previous question asked by me so sir can i think that this inversion layer which is formed i ca can i think that as a metal layer and the capacitance which we are uh mentioning in this at the inversion point is the capacitance between the gate and the inversion layer yes yes right sir so and uh one more thing sir uh so what about the i'm like yeah this question was asked by maher even so what about the capacitance between the inversion layer and the body they are connected any charge can flow from an inversion layer to the body so how can there be a capacitance between them but but there would be a depletion region in between them right sir uh and depletion region doesn't mean charges cannot flow from there depletion region only means there are no charges available there oh so uh uh even uh there's no capacitance between them yeah okay sir oh thank you okay uh theta in that case we can call it as a depletion there i'm sorry depletion we can call it as a depletion capacitance uh we have a metal oxide and there is a channel and below that there is a uh depletion also we can call this we can call this as our uh depletion and the channel and the substrate has a depletion capacitance yeah so you see we are calling it depletion capacitance over here absolutely right okay so after forming the channel also uh we can say that the gate and gate oxide and channel has one capacitance and the channel depletion region under substrate as another capacitance so they are in the series no sir yeah yeah but the change in charge is happening over here at low frequency change in charge happens over here at high frequency change in charge happens over here so at low frequency the capacitance is large at high frequency capacitance goes down oh sorry even in the low frequency also the depletion region will be let there be a capacitance what would you observe at the gate you change something at what place will you see the change in charge that defines the thickness that you need to consider when you measure capacitance okay okay so i've got it but okay physically those exist doesn't matter okay but that doesn't come into the electrical plane so it doesn't matter it doesn't change anything for you yes okay yeah i think you can cover only till here today but anything else um sir uh question on this slide only so you have written uh on the upper part that mos transistor cv at any frequency so basically it won't have this high frequency effect if i have a transistor yes so that is evident in the previous slide so if there is an if there is a source or drain region over here the electrons will simply change from here to here they don't have to travel the width of the depletion layer okay so one more question yeah stuff about the depletion uh i mean if i want to understand that then can we say that uh okay when the depletion is happening so at the at the time when that band bending happens so basically the holes move away from the interface that we were saying surface of that and then the ions are only there so they cannot uh conduct right so yeah okay that is what depletion layer is okay okay if the graph cylinder graph slide the water squashy static cv washi static cv quasi static cv means that this is dynamic in nature in the sense that it appears as a constant cv like a constant cv curve but what happens is that there is a constant change or flow of electrons between source drain and this inversion layer or stuff like that so it's quasi-static it's not as soon as you will change the charge as soon as you will remove the voltages uh there is no capacitance there again see a metal oxide metal this capacitance is always there whether there is a charge when you whether you apply a voltage there or not yes but in a mosfet the capacitance and its value is quasi-static it depends on the region of operation so it is not a static cv it is quasi static it changes with the region of operation yeah okay so sir yes so uh the question gandhi asked at any f can you please elaborate uh i couldn't get it when he asked that at any f at any frequency in the top part for mosfet for mosfet the charges can come from the source and drain region the distance between source gain region and that of the body is very different so in mosfet even at high frequencies you will see a higher capacitance after inversion layer is pumped because inversion layer still continues to change in terms of amount of charge okay however in a mos capacitor that doesn't happen okay so that any phosphorous mosfet business okay okay see that you have a question your hand is raised okay so if there are no more questions we will close it here yes sir depletion reason starts from the flat band voltage and go up to the threshold voltage according to this figure yes so in the fragment voltage there is no band bending occurs after that in the flat band voltage there is no band bending because everything is flat yeah yeah yeah then the band bending stretch so after that bend bending uh start again in the reverse direction of accumulation yeah okay okay okay uh sir hello just to confirm that in when we are talking about the frequency we are ensuring that the basic offset of vt is there and about that only the frequency of the signal above that is guaranteed yeah we're talking about small signal models over here okay okay davidjit sir just one question sir how the band bending determines uh my uh vt of the device would be okay so let us say the intrinsic band bending is 500 millivolts okay so if 500 millivolts so in at 0 volts if i say i have already reached uh let us look at it like this at 0 volts there is some band bending that is already happening to create the inversion layer i need to apply some more voltage and i will get it now if my curve was such that flat band happened till here and then band bending happened like this then the vt would come here somewhere here okay so the more the band bending that already happens because of my uh gate dielectric interface whatever okay the more band mending that already happens the lesser the vp would be sure because i need lesser bending for bringing in the inversion layer okay so from this what you have told can you come can we say that if there is more band bending then we'll be for will be at resting stage will be further we will be further away from the vt so for those type of devices which would be less no no no if band banding is more already it means a inversion layer is easy to form so vt is going to be less yes so vt is going to be less sub threshold okay yes okay anything else okay so thank you guys we will start with mos transistors next class uh and then we will move to other devices okay thank you one servant yes sir uh in david's question uh sir he told that vt is less than how we told that it is in the it is the it is in the sub threshold i'm sorry sir uh sir you don't know that in that the more the backbending the bt gets lesser so how we determine that it is in the sub regulator oh that's because at lower vt when you have less vt then the sub threshold currents are higher that's the only thing don't worry about it we will talk about the current if you've studied current equations of mosfets earlier you will see that okay so thank you guys all the best see you on friday then thank you sir,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMe2mvwtX2M,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMe2mvwtX2M
Transcript: so i will need to stop the recording over here for a minute uh because my okay so uh we just earlier talked about the fact here you have a question your hand is raised oh no sorry sir so uh we were just talking about the fact that due to band bending in the semiconductor region the mosfet capacitor would behave different the mos capacitor would behave differently than a metal capacitor a metal oxide metal capacitor so to be able to characterize this what we do is we apply a voltage between substrate and the gate and we say that we will vary this voltage v and we want to observe the you know the change in charge and the change in capacitance or the flow of current that is happening to measure the capacitance there okay and you see what happens over time when i apply a negative voltage on the gate what would happen when i apply a negative voltage on the gate though this is a p times substrate more holes would accumulate at the surface of silicon are you able to see this yes yes sir huh yes so this part is called accumulation now when i say that i reduce that negative voltage i bring the voltage closer to zero then what happens then we we looked at uh this band bending diagram and this voltage at both the nodes was zero so uh i would have this kind of a band bending happening there so if you look at it carefully what we are talking about it is that at the surface of of the silicon over here my es is kind of coinciding with the fermi level so what i would say is that there is some so when it is at the fermi level what does that mean that the silicon behavior in this region would be something like intrinsic silicon are you able to see this so if e s is equal to e i we call it as intrinsic silicon that nothing is doped there is no doping am i right yes over here if you look at it carefully uh see e i would be something like this over here in the center of ef and ec ef and economy easy and easy so yeah it's the band of silicon right no ei is the intrinsic energy level which is in the center of easy and easy intrinsic energy okay ei the red one that i am showing that's called ei okay okay so over here we see that e i and e f are almost coinciding due to band bending so i have intrinsic silicon so i would say things are almost depleted there okay and what happens is that in this region node if i if i change the voltage by a small value of few millivolts here and there there will be no charge change over here at the surface the charge would change at the boundary of this depletion layer there will be slightly extra bending or slightly lesser bending okay because at the surface it is almost intrinsic now any change any more charge or any less charge the change would happen at the boundary of the depletion rate uh so so just just to like clarify so uh can you go back to the previous slide this one uh uh no no okay i meant that uh yeah this one so here near the surface of i mean near the boundary of um your your silicon and your silicon dioxide your intrinsic energy level is coinciding with the fermi level so there it behaves like intrinsic silicon so there's not much accumulation over there but uh when you go away from the boundary it uh it approaches the conduction uh yeah you start to get more charges so so that there it behaves more like an n-type that's b-type over here it's e-type yeah but sir if it's uh if your intrinsic level is closer to the conduction band the intrinsic level is always in the center okay so when the band's been intrinsic level also is shown to be bending it is also a notional level right so um yeah so there if it's like regular p-type then why do we see a depletion region over there depletion means there are no uh like if you need charges more charges there are not many charges available here because it's almost intrinsic oh okay okay so like relatively it's uh relative and compared to the other one it's like end time even though it's just intrinsic silicon yeah okay right okay so what happens because there are no charges in this region any charges you need you will get them from the remaining depth of the silicon okay so any change in charge density would happen at the boundary of my bending so my effective ox dielectric thickness see when we say that my dielectric there are these two metal one metal two and there is this dielectric in between we say that the capacitance is equal to epsilon uh by a let us say okay epsilon into uh like epsilon a by d ox i know as t ox reduces your capacitance increases okay so what are we saying over here we are saying that my t-ox we are saying that this is my capacitor because i change a small voltage over here there is a small change in capacitance right after t ox but in silicon we are saying that that change in charge happens at t ox plus w d so what happens the denominator becomes t ox plus wd what does that mean that my capacitance would reduce right right okay okay now effectively a capacitor with with in series with another yeah i know then uh if i do still more apply still more voltage over there then there will be still more band bending still more band bending would mean let us say this and this would mean that i had a p-type but in this region i have an n-type material now because my fermi level is very close to the conduction band because of so high band bending okay so this is called as inversion layer and now if i want to change any charge there is so many so many charged particles available over here all that movement of charge can happen from the inversion layer itself so again my oxide thickness comes out to be t-ox okay so when you increase the voltage over here like this you see that initially the capacitance is high why is it high it is high because the change in charge is happening across the oxide only this is the accumulation region after some time we see that oh this capacitance starts to decrease why does it start to decrease because this depletion layer starts to get formed and this depletion layer means there are no float no available charges there so that the any change in charge would happen at the boundary of the depletion layer but all of a sudden what happens an inversion layer is formed and additional change of charge happens at the surface of or at the interface of silicon and silicon dioxide again so this is the low frequency transfer characteristic or characteristic of the mass capacitor now why did i say low frequency so maybe because at low frequency only that interface would be changing at higher frequencies so it will remain at low frequency what happens is at low frequency what happens is my let us say this is the band bending thing happening there so at low frequencies what happens is i have sufficient time to move electrons from here to substrate sufficient time to do that and therefore any change in electron density would happen at this interface at very high frequency what happens is uh if i'm moving very very very very fast so what happens is electron starts to go out but it has not even crossed the depletion region when the polarity has changed so the electrons of this region remain here only so where does any change in electrons happen it happens at the depletion width boundary again and therefore at very high frequencies the mass capacitance will behave as a very less capacitance sir yes sir could you explain this inversion layer again sir inversion layer what do you understand by inversion layer till now sir uh i'm like what i understood is that uh there is a another layer which is being formed in between like depletion and this layer so see we had a p-type silicon am i right yes sir now due to band bending the surface of the silicon has more density of electrons now yes so that at the surface it has now become n-type okay sir yes sir yes that is why it is called inversion because the polarity of the material we had we had physically of p-type material but at the surface we now have a n-type material okay that is why it is called inversion layer uh sir i mean even in depletion region also we we do have this electrons right sir first suppose uh no you do not have that kind of a density of electrons as you would have in an n type material depletion region actually has all is kind of depleted of any moving moving carriers that is why it is called depletion region okay i'm like due to this high voltage or something we are getting free electrons in that region yes okay sir thank you sir because so much band bending has happened electrons can very easily come there here rajneesh [Music] so ei is always designed or always shown as bit as the center of band gap it is a constant value e i is a notional number or a notional energy level where no electron can exist can sit there but it is shown as the center of the band gap it is an energy level which is equidistant from the valence band and the conduction band both ef on the other hand is derived from fermi direct statistics which says that probability of electrons above this is 50 and below this is also 50 percent ef is also a national energy level yes it is also a notional energy level however es will be different uh years will be closer to the conduction band in n-type material and valence band in p-type material e i will always be equidistant from both okay yes fashionable sir uh yes sir actually when this inversion layer form sir uh are the depletion electrons even present so i mean like below them depletion has no moving carriers yes sir i'm i was asking only about the layers here not the electrons or the carriers is that present over there depletion layer is always there there are there are some there are silicon atoms there yes sir i mean so there is there is a flood of electrons also there therefore we call it electro uh inversion layer so where are these electrons actually moving from sorry i mean like our voltage is being given between the gate and the body to be precise uh right sir so uh where are these electrons exactly moving sir so if the depletion region is in between uh gate and body and over there if the oh over that if the inversion line is being formed then uh i don't see any uh charge transfer or something or the current transfer between the gate and the body the gate and the body do not have any charge transfer capacitor does not allow charge to move from gate to the from one terminal to the other it cannot happen can it there is a silicon dioxide barrier in between nothing would ever move from gate to the body okay that is why we have silicon dioxide is it not that is the meaning of a capacitor but the two plates are not physically connected but they are influencing each of those behavior so what is happening i change something on the gate the behavior on the silicon side changes that is what a capacitance is okay sir we are only talking about the capacitance value that's it uh not about any uh current flow or something yeah thank you sir so so this high frequency model so i couldn't get it so this yeah so the high frequency model rather is about uh the fact that see it takes some picoseconds even if it is picoseconds for an electron to move out from the inversion layer to the substrate to the body henna now if i'm operating at a small signal level which is say 20 gigahertz how much time do i have just a few picoseconds the electron may not be able to physically move out from the inversion layer to the body but some voltage change is happening so some charge change is happening somewhere it cannot happen if it is not happening in the inversion layer it can only happen at the boundary of the depletion layer so like when i've crossed the vt voltage i have my inversion layer form so now i can see a effective capacitance thickness of t-ox now if i increase beyond vt now but still i will have that inversion layer right so so i mean i can understand that why that uh like i should go up like that because uh even if i'm fasting changing and changing very fast even the very frequency is very fast but still that inversion there exists so the t-ox is constant so what additional charge what is the capacitance we discussed that a little while back the capacitance is about or the thickness of oxide or whatever we talk about is about there is one plate there is another plate i change something here something changes on this plate that is the effect of spacing between the two plates is it not now there is this television layer here fine but nothing is changing there because there is no time for it to change only change is happening here only at the edge of the depletion boundary so this is my effective capacitance okay so inversion inversion liquid capacitance will be there but additional to that at the depletion end also no inver at very high frequency inversion layer does not have any influence on capacitance because it cannot change any charges the charges in the inversion layer cannot change yes in response to the change in gate voltage okay answer but still why it is getting constant then after that at the high frequency model shouldn't be some kind of depletion depletion width cannot grow beyond a particular maximum level any further voltage you apply there will be more charges in the in the inversion layer depletion widths cannot go beyond that okay so after the high frequency model the change the the changes in charge the delta q is happening at the very uh at the wd max depletion rate okay okay so it becomes this inversion becomes a constant basically okay sir yes i'm sorry so yeah i had this uh i had a question regarding depletion there only so like uh when we are going from um you know your depletion region to your inversion region so like it's accumulation of like effectively free electrons is just happening on the boundary right but as it happens so somewhere between the inversion layer to your body there has to be a depletion there right so the depletion layer so the depletion layer would always be there but at low frequency the charges in the electro and the inversion layer can change okay therefore the effective capacitance that you see increases because the t-ox changes or the effective distance between the two plates their charges are changing reduces right right okay sir yes sir uh my doubt was the same i'm like that this is an addition to the previous question asked by me so sir can i think that this inversion layer which is formed i ca can i think that as a metal layer and the capacitance which we are uh mentioning in this at the inversion point is the capacitance between the gate and the inversion layer yes yes right sir so and uh one more thing sir uh so what about the i'm like yeah this question was asked by maher even so what about the capacitance between the inversion layer and the body they are connected any charge can flow from an inversion layer to the body so how can there be a capacitance between them but but there would be a depletion region in between them right sir uh and depletion region doesn't mean charges cannot flow from there depletion region only means there are no charges available there oh so uh uh even uh there's no capacitance between them yeah okay sir oh thank you okay uh theta in that case we can call it as a depletion there i'm sorry depletion we can call it as a depletion capacitance uh we have a metal oxide and there is a channel and below that there is a uh depletion also we can call this we can call this as our uh depletion and the channel and the substrate has a depletion capacitance yeah so you see we are calling it depletion capacitance over here absolutely right okay so after forming the channel also uh we can say that the gate and gate oxide and channel has one capacitance and the channel depletion region under substrate as another capacitance so they are in the series no sir yeah yeah but the change in charge is happening over here at low frequency change in charge happens over here at high frequency change in charge happens over here so at low frequency the capacitance is large at high frequency capacitance goes down oh sorry even in the low frequency also the depletion region will be let there be a capacitance what would you observe at the gate you change something at what place will you see the change in charge that defines the thickness that you need to consider when you measure capacitance okay okay so i've got it but okay physically those exist doesn't matter okay but that doesn't come into the electrical plane so it doesn't matter it doesn't change anything for you yes okay yeah i think you can cover only till here today but anything else um sir uh question on this slide only so you have written uh on the upper part that mos transistor cv at any frequency so basically it won't have this high frequency effect if i have a transistor yes so that is evident in the previous slide so if there is an if there is a source or drain region over here the electrons will simply change from here to here they don't have to travel the width of the depletion layer okay so one more question yeah stuff about the depletion uh i mean if i want to understand that then can we say that uh okay when the depletion is happening so at the at the time when that band bending happens so basically the holes move away from the interface that we were saying surface of that and then the ions are only there so they cannot uh conduct right so yeah okay that is what depletion layer is okay okay if the graph cylinder graph slide the water squashy static cv washi static cv quasi static cv means that this is dynamic in nature in the sense that it appears as a constant cv like a constant cv curve but what happens is that there is a constant change or flow of electrons between source drain and this inversion layer or stuff like that so it's quasi-static it's not as soon as you will change the charge as soon as you will remove the voltages uh there is no capacitance there again see a metal oxide metal this capacitance is always there whether there is a charge when you whether you apply a voltage there or not yes but in a mosfet the capacitance and its value is quasi-static it depends on the region of operation so it is not a static cv it is quasi static it changes with the region of operation yeah okay so sir yes so uh the question gandhi asked at any f can you please elaborate uh i couldn't get it when he asked that at any f at any frequency in the top part for mosfet for mosfet the charges can come from the source and drain region the distance between source gain region and that of the body is very different so in mosfet even at high frequencies you will see a higher capacitance after inversion layer is pumped because inversion layer still continues to change in terms of amount of charge okay however in a mos capacitor that doesn't happen okay so that any phosphorous mosfet business okay okay see that you have a question your hand is raised okay so if there are no more questions we will close it here yes sir depletion reason starts from the flat band voltage and go up to the threshold voltage according to this figure yes so in the fragment voltage there is no band bending occurs after that in the flat band voltage there is no band bending because everything is flat yeah yeah yeah then the band bending stretch so after that bend bending uh start again in the reverse direction of accumulation yeah okay okay okay uh sir hello just to confirm that in when we are talking about the frequency we are ensuring that the basic offset of vt is there and about that only the frequency of the signal above that is guaranteed yeah we're talking about small signal models over here okay okay davidjit sir just one question sir how the band bending determines uh my uh vt of the device would be okay so let us say the intrinsic band bending is 500 millivolts okay so if 500 millivolts so in at 0 volts if i say i have already reached uh let us look at it like this at 0 volts there is some band bending that is already happening to create the inversion layer i need to apply some more voltage and i will get it now if my curve was such that flat band happened till here and then band bending happened like this then the vt would come here somewhere here okay so the more the band bending that already happens because of my uh gate dielectric interface whatever okay the more band mending that already happens the lesser the vp would be sure because i need lesser bending for bringing in the inversion layer okay so from this what you have told can you come can we say that if there is more band bending then we'll be for will be at resting stage will be further we will be further away from the vt so for those type of devices which would be less no no no if band banding is more already it means a inversion layer is easy to form so vt is going to be less yes so vt is going to be less sub threshold okay yes okay anything else okay so thank you guys we will start with mos transistors next class uh and then we will move to other devices okay thank you one servant yes sir uh in david's question uh sir he told that vt is less than how we told that it is in the it is the it is in the sub threshold i'm sorry sir uh sir you don't know that in that the more the backbending the bt gets lesser so how we determine that it is in the sub regulator oh that's because at lower vt when you have less vt then the sub threshold currents are higher that's the only thing don't worry about it we will talk about the current if you've studied current equations of mosfets earlier you will see that okay so thank you guys all the best see you on friday then thank you sir"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,AiH62PY8_-U,okay then so today what we are going to cover is mos transistors okay so this is a mosfet what do different parts of this region represent can anyone tell me like however again i still want to hear it from you so source and drain and channel and gate and substrate is there right good so we understand that one of this is source this we call as drain this is the gate region which we say is made of polysilicon this you can call as gate oxide this blackened region is channel where we say that the inversion layer already exists the channel has already been formed and this is isolation so this is also silicon dioxide okay so so that is because of field oxide right yes that isolation has free oxide yes yes there was a question another question no sir i was asking the same isolation yeah so it was field offside and uh it is called isolation these days because it is no longer grown in the way the field oxide was grown it is today uh you know there is a trench that is uh that is etched out in the silicon and the new deposit oxide so it is called shallow trench implant but yes that is oxide that that separates two adjacent transistors source and drain regions from each other okay so given that so what we just now showed was that there is uh uh same voltage at source and drain if we apply a different voltage at source and then what happens the start starts to move and you also experience what is called as pinch off you see the channel has become tapered uh oh my ppt has stopped operating again okay let me pause the recording once you should not feel sorry for asking to restart the recording yeah so when we apply a differential voltage between the source and the drain then what happens current starts to flow and we see that this channel is no longer flat we see that this channel starts to taper and we see a pinch off happening here okay so you remember all of this this this you must have all done in your earlier course on the electron yes great so pinch off happens and what does cinch off do pinch off says that oh now since pinch-off has happened the change in current that would flow would be less so in fact we call it as saturation that level after this even if you increase vds any further there will be no change in current ids at the same gate source voltage okay and these are the equations that we remember from earlier sessions earlier classes on mosfet behavior all of you remember these so rattanimana i don't need to memorize them but you remember that these equations were there in the linear region current would would vary like this so as increase the w the current would increase if you increase the length the current would reduce mobility being higher for the nmosses and mosses have larger current than pmosses so all these concepts you remember am i right for saturation we are dependent on v g s minus v t the whole square and in an ideal mosfet there is there is very limited change in in current after saturation has set in and which is due to channel length modulation clears uh yeah sir it's like kind of basic but i have always wondered how we arrived at the first equation for the linear region so this whole thing that okay you uh you take the v overdrive and then subtract i mean and you subtract vds by two from that i mean uh how do we get that so again uh here these are models we observed silicon we observed the behavior of on silicon and we modeled it and we found that this is the correct model okay then we justified it okay this is happening because of this this physical phenomena happening there but you will realize it is all models you see the current and you will model it and then you will look for ways to justify it in fact so many phenomena that you will see in advanced technologies they were discovered because the model changed okay okay that's purely experimental yeah it starts with experimental then you justify it with physics okay so is my gate overdrive gate over type a dependent schema that you understand yes sir vdsp dependent square that also you understand yeah yeah so that is what is most important to capture okay this is a square dependence cubic dependence uh three times you know uh which kind of dependence it is that that is largely curve fitting happening there okay intuitively you need to understand okay this is this is dependent on vgs minus vt now square linear all those things you also need to understand but they're all models based on what we studied in the experiment what we found in the experiments okay for example in the linear region you would say that my mosfet characteristics are like this okay so as vgs changes in this region my uh resistance changes uh linearly whereas uh in the saturation region uh the current value that i will get will depend on something so you have to have pictures so these are all models that have been made based on what we observed on silicon and that has been then justified physically much more of it you will get in ssd course okay okay but we remember these two curves and we remember these uh equations before you have a question yes sir sir can we say that uh charges are also get saturated due to uh saturation of current at fields of point i'm sorry uh charging can also be uh saturated at due to saturation of current at pins of point charges can be saturated charges uh serpents are fine okay a [Music] [Music] but okay if you want to say it like that you can but i would say that because of pinch-off there is no further increase in current okay so who's pointing for like uh electrons depletion region yeah so okay this is very interesting so tell me one thing when we say that when we say that this is uh this is this triangle there so what is this triangle is it like what is the depth of this inversion layer we made this triangle over here so what is what does this triangle represent what is the depth of inversion layer [Music] yes actually the triangle over there now it basically depends on the vds equal to vgs minus vth types or i'm like at every point over there uh where the pinch-off happens uh from there uh i'm like vds equal to vgs minus vts then the pinch-off starts to happen as as its entering point of saturation so if we consider each point in that channel uh then the voltage gets decreased i mean like uh vds voltage gets decreased that's the reason why we get to a triangle over there okay so what is the depth of the inversion layer depth of the inversion i'm like initially the inversion inversion layer which was formed before the saturation uh i think that's the same same length over near the source if i am not wrong and these ones are i think we have to integrate it if i'm not wrong uh or something uh depending on the conditions uh it was mentioned as such in the rasabi books that's so this is a concentration yes right this just the concentration so the width is almost zero so this representation is the concentration of charges in the channel so inversion layer is only at the surface this triangle that we represent is the charge density in the inversion layer do not consider this as a physical depth inversion layer is always always always at the surface remember the band bending band bending at the surface this is where you know ei so you have a band bending operator this is the place where your inversion layer exists it has no depth the depth that is shown here that appears to be depth that is just the graph of charge density of electrons and what is the probability of finding electrons in this region so you see that pinch-off happens matlab now electrons have got so much energy they don't stop you cannot find them they just rushed into the drain region you can't even locate them in this region it's not fast for move circuit and therefore when you increase the voltage what happens only more electrons move faster and faster and faster so pinch off becomes steeper and steeper okay okay so yes so i couldn't get the like there's no depth so i i mean inversion layer needs to have will have some like it has no technique it is at the surface there is the surface all the electrons are on the surface all the transistor behavior that you are looking at is at the surface at the surface of silicon at the interface of oxide and silicon no depth a nanometer of depth that's it you won't you don't call it depth because it's not depth it's there at the surface okay okay so only like it's like a sheet of like electrons yes it's a sheet of electrons there that's the inversion layer okay okay sir yes so uh what is i'm like what do you mean by the charge density exactly sir i mean like there are no charges below the inversion layer or is it something different so what do you understand by the term electron density electron is i'm like charge per unit area if i'm not wrong yeah so that that is the kind of electrons you will have at the surface in that sheet that we talked about there are so many electrons that you could locate in that sheet but after the pinch-off happens after the pinch-off happens what happens now electrons have just moved out into the drain region yes sir i mean i do understand that but my doubt was that literally there are the electrons over here right there there are electrons creating this triangle kind of thing uh no there is no depth of this triangle this is charge density that is what i am trying to clarify okay okay okay so now i notice there is no physical triangle there that is what i want to clarify okay okay thank you sir okay uh sir just to clarify this concept i mean so as we are increasing the drain voltage i mean beyond the saturation region then it's uh the depletion layer between the drain and the um and the substrate is just increasing and that's why we don't you know it it sort of remains the secretion region was always there the entire region is depletion region yeah but it starts increasing right no depletion region once it reaches wd max and inversion layer has formed depletion region will not increase so but uh then you have channel with modulation i mean that's where it's dependent or videos because your effective uh train to source length is decreasing your channel length is equation okay so that that is when you say that okay now this region also became depletion or this region also became depletion so the depletion region beneath this d would increase this is not transistor action now this is parasitic you may say okay i'm not so sure how this is working so when you apply some voltage so this is n plus and this is p yeah see avid and most capacitors we were looking at only this part even this was not there is that clear yeah are you with me till here yeah now we've added source and drain regions so what happened there was a depletion region over here which was formed because of the gate but now because of this n plus and p region and this n plus and p region there is a depletion layer that is formed on this region also all right okay so now when you increase vb what happens this depletion region increases yeah okay so what happens your t has channel length modulation okay it is not this wd max the gate control wd max cannot change okay okay okay so is this concept clear that inversion layer is just on the surface of silicon and that it's it's just a sheet of electrons and what we represent as a triangle over here is electron density at given x so sir can i say that and the sheet of sheet of electrons the the distribution of electrons is not homogeneous it's like different that's why we are getting this uh kind of triangle okay yes because the electrons as they come close to the drain they just rush out so you there is no sheet there you can't see them it doesn't they don't appear like a sheet that's the one but that's what the model says again this is modeling up electrons to suction yeah yes yes this is modeling but even then what is important to realize is all this is happening at the surface okay yes sir yes yeah that's yeah uh sorry after finch there will be no right uh at the train yet uh there will be sheet will be cut right like so there are electrons there but they are moving so far that they don't appear as sheet now they just get absorbed into the drain they are going very fast through the depletion layer or there will be at the surface at the surface also there will be depletion uh depletion layer will be there yeah but yeah that is a diffusion all that part is depletion yes okay so this

that is etched out in the silicon and the new deposit oxide so it is called shallow trench implant but yes that is oxide that that separates two adjacent transistors source and drain regions from each other okay so given that so what we just now showed was that there is uh uh same voltage at source and drain if we apply a different voltage at source and then what happens the start starts to move and you also experience what is called as pinch off you see the channel has become tapered uh oh my ppt has stopped operating again okay let me pause the recording once you should not feel sorry for asking to restart the recording yeah so when we apply a differential voltage between the source and the drain then what happens current starts to flow and we see that this channel is no longer flat we see that this channel starts to taper and we see a pinch off happening here okay so you remember all of this this this you must have all done in your earlier course on the electron yes great so pinch off happens and what does cinch off do pinch off says that oh now since pinch-off has happened the change in current that would flow would be less so in fact we call it as saturation that level after

think that's the same same length over near the source if i am not wrong and these ones are i think we have to integrate it if i'm not wrong uh or something uh depending on the conditions uh it was mentioned as such in the rasabi books that's so this is a concentration yes right this just the concentration so the width is almost zero so this representation is the concentration of charges in the channel so inversion layer is only at the surface this triangle that we represent is the charge density in the inversion layer do not consider this as a physical depth inversion layer is always always always at the surface remember the band bending band bending at the surface this is where you know ei so you have a band bending operator this is the place where your inversion layer exists it has no depth the depth that is shown here that appears to be depth that is just the graph of charge density of electrons and what is the probability of finding electrons in this region so you see that pinch-off happens matlab now electrons have got so much energy they don't stop you cannot find them they just rushed into the drain region you can't even locate them in this region it's not fast for move circuit and therefore when you increase the voltage what happens only more electrons move faster and faster and faster so pinch off becomes steeper and steeper okay okay so yes so i couldn't get the like there's no depth so i i mean inversion layer needs to have will have some like it has no technique it is at the surface there is the surface all the electrons are on the surface all the transistor behavior that you are looking at is at the surface at the surface of silicon at the interface of oxide and silicon no depth a nanometer of depth that's it you won't you don't call it depth because it's not depth it's there at the surface okay okay so only like it's like a sheet of like electrons yes it's a sheet of electrons there that's the inversion layer okay okay sir yes so uh what is i'm like what do you mean by the charge density exactly sir i mean like there are no charges below the inversion layer or is it something different so what do you understand by the term electron density electron is i'm like charge per unit area if i'm not wrong yeah so that that is the kind of electrons you will have at the surface in that sheet that we talked about there are so many electrons that you could locate in that sheet but after the pinch-off happens after the pinch-off happens what happens now electrons have just moved out into the drain region yes sir i mean i do understand that but my doubt was that literally there are the electrons over here right there there are electrons creating this triangle kind of thing uh no there is no depth of this triangle this is charge density that is what i am trying to clarify okay okay okay so now i notice there is no physical triangle there that is what i want to clarify okay okay thank you sir okay uh sir just to clarify this concept i mean so as we are increasing the drain voltage i mean beyond the saturation region then it's uh the depletion layer between the drain and the um and the substrate is just increasing and that's why we don't you know it it sort of remains the secretion region was always there the entire region is depletion region yeah but it starts increasing right no depletion region once it reaches wd max and inversion layer has formed depletion region will not increase so but uh then you have channel with modulation i mean that's where it's dependent or videos because your effective uh train to source length is decreasing your channel length is equation okay so that that is when you say that okay now this region also became depletion or this region also became depletion so the depletion region beneath this d would increase this is not transistor action now this is parasitic you may say okay i'm not so sure how this is working so when you apply some voltage so this is n plus and this is p yeah see avid and most capacitors we were looking at only this part even this was not there is that clear yeah are you with me till here yeah now we've added source and drain regions so what happened there was a depletion region over here which was formed because of the gate but now because of this n plus and p region and this n plus and p region there is a depletion layer that is formed on this region also all right okay so now when you increase vb what happens this depletion region increases yeah okay so what happens your t has channel length modulation okay it is not this wd max the gate control wd max cannot change okay okay okay so is this concept clear that inversion layer is just on the surface of silicon and that it's it's just a sheet of electrons and what we represent as a triangle over here is electron density at given x so sir can i say that and the sheet of sheet of electrons the the distribution of electrons is not homogeneous it's like different that's why we are getting this uh kind of triangle okay yes because the electrons as they come close to the drain they just rush out so you there is no sheet there you can't see them it doesn't they don't appear like a sheet that's the one but that's what the model says again this is modeling up electrons to suction yeah yes yes this is modeling but even then what is important to realize is all this is happening at the surface okay yes sir yes yeah that's yeah uh sorry after finch there will be no right uh at the train yet uh there will be sheet will be cut right like so there are electrons there but they are moving so far that they don't appear as sheet now they just get absorbed into the drain they are going very fast through the depletion layer or there will be at the surface at the surface also there will be depletion uh depletion layer will be there yeah but yeah that is a diffusion all that part is depletion yes okay so this is"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,JTafhAtqi6w,okay so what also happens is in silicon so till the time we apply or we have limited electric fields in the channel region let us go back to the previous slide so till the time we have limited electric fields in this channel region what happens as you apply more voltage on drain electric field increases so as you increase the voltage on drain the velocity of electrons over here increases so pinch-off happens because the electrons move very very fast so you're not even able to observe them over here so the velocity of electrons increases but there comes a point in time where there can be no further increase in velocity why because then these electrons start to collide with the nuclei of uh you know the atoms over there or there are obstacles that they start to hit them and therefore the overall speed kind of saturates okay that is called as velocity saturation and how does that affect or why is it important for us how does that affect us it affects us because if we have a long channel device then what we would observe is that there is a increase in current until vgs minus vt the entire gate overdrive region whereas in very small devices what we observe is that the saturation starts to happen earlier this is because of velocity saturation okay so when we scaled you know when we came to advanced technologies and short channel effects started to appear we started to observe oh yeah our old model had said we should get this kind of current we are getting only this kind of current what is happening then the concept of velocity saturation was devised created and we said that in short channel devices instead of that vgs minus vt we would say current saturates at what is called as vdd sat sir yes sir uh can't we say that because the channel length is slow that's the reason why we have vgs minus vts low or is it due to velocity i'm like okay let me let me ask it against what is electric field what is electric field let us look at that again coming back to the very basic question there yes a rate of change of potential so delta v by l yeah yes sir yes sir as i go to a short channel device what happens l reduces yes for the same delta v what happens due to this increase in electric field we observe that velocity saturation has happened now electrons cannot really go to the same speed as they were in the lower electric field okay okay so basically it even depends i'm like it it's interlinked towards the length even uh i mean it is linked to length so that is where long channel and short channel devices are being talked about okay thank you okay uh sir can i repeat again why do we have um why do we achieve saturation i mean earlier in short channel devices okay is it is it evident that the electric fields will be higher in short channel devices yeah yeah okay so we will achieve higher electric fields in short channel devices earlier right now at high electric field what happens but sir um wouldn't the high electric field be you know dependent on at the width of the debris i mean depletion region instead of the actual uh the channel length okay so now over here we are talking about transversal effects electric field the electric field between source and drain okay source right we're not talking so sorry this is a little confusing but there are there's a vertical electric field and there's a transversal electric field flow of charge from source to drain happens because of transversal electric field okay yeah that is what saturates and that is what increases so much because length has reduced that we observe velocity saturation of the electrons there okay okay all right got it okay what's up here just took somebody for one thing the short channel means like 65 nanometer 14 nanometer that kind of thing right yeah it could also mean 130 nanometer it could also mean 180 nanometers yeah yeah okay okay so short channel depends so uh if you were to you know enter into ssd course you will see that short channel uh depends on doping and the doping profile and so many things so when the region of uh you know when when this region this region that we're talking about okay when this region no longer remains as rectangular as we want it to be we say short channel effects will start to appear okay so there is a relationship between the length of the device and the depth of this depletion region when the depth of the decreation region uh increases too much in comparison to the length we say short channel effects will appear so this can happen at any length it depends on various things but in terms of technology short channel effects becomes significantly more prominent at advanced technology notes because then you cannot even change the doping see over here in older technologies you could increase the substrate doping a bit so that the depletion width remains less but in advanced technologies it's already so high that you cannot increase it any further and you go to various different kinds of implants retrograde implant halo implants super halo implants and so on so that is where ssd my java they will get much more information about this in this course let us simply understand it as that uh in when short channel effects figure in transversal electric field becomes very very high and in that uh at that time velocity saturation happens and you see that current doesn't grow as we wanted it to okay yeah sure so yes when electric field is increasing does it mean that so velocity saturation is happening because there is more collision yes the speed has become so high that every now the collisions the collision rate increases so much that velocity cannot really increase beyond that so we have reached that electric field at which saturation happens saturation happens saturation happens at a particular electric field because now this electric field will not increase the velocity and in short channel devices you reach that electric field much faster much earlier but isn't the rate of collision dependent on density of other atoms that are present in so why it's just mine yes sir i know so it is dependent on that let us okay so i have an electron moving from here to that base okay averagely there are 10 000 electrons that are moving of those 10 000 electrons every second or every microsecond every nanosecond whatever we call it every picosecond 20 electrons will hit some atom okay so that when they hit they come to a halt so you say they have got decelerated so velocity does not increase or there is a rate of change of velocity and that is time now at very high electric fields electrons so many electrons are moving so fast and they are so like the the number of collisions because the electrons are moving very very fast increases so much that overall deceleration increases significantly number of electrons hitting atoms increases significantly and therefore velocity cannot increase any further it is not saying that velocity would reduce but any further increase in velocity is offset by the increase in number of uh collisions okay so okay saturated no further increase because any further increases also means increases in further collisions okay anymore it has been controlled by the collision it is limited by the not controlled yeah uh devotee rajesh you have questions yes sir so in one of the previous slide we observed that as soon as a pinch-off is occurring so the current is getting uh saturated it is not increasing but uh in in uh just the previous slide we also observed that you in the short channel devices uh as soon as it is reaching a certain vd after that saturation is occurring so what will happen if it means vd is less than here vgs minus vt so what will happen when it reaches vgs minus vt means what will happen to the pinch of means so it will happen yeah yeah okay so pinch off will now uh occur in vgs minus vt only for so again you know that is where i have been insisting that we've been trying to model what is uh observed on silicon through these equations okay so if we say that now saturation is happening at vdsat and you want to use that simple model of pinch-off only then you would come arrive at a conclusion that pinch-off happens at vdsat yes sir okay yes but no one talks about pinch off when you talk about wedishat but if you want to use that model then that is what will appear to be the case yes sir okay thank you sir in that velocity saturation graphs previous two slides please do you want to see that slide yes in this sir this is uh easy uh that is the critical pillar sir in case of both long channel and short channel this mu will be same so uh will this ec be different for when there is long channel in short channel that is no this is the behavior of silicon okay irrespective of long channel and short channel this will all this thing will be same everything this is the behavior of silicon this has nothing to do with the channel length so in silicon if there are two points two electrodes you apply anywhere you apply when the electric field goes beyond 1.5 there will be no further change in voltage uh electron velocity this is the behavior of silicon okay so uh i read in a book that there was written that in the long channel model carrier mobility is independent of of applied fields but uh nothing was written when the channel becomes shorter when you bias see that what happens again again i would come back with the same thing see what we are what what everyone is doing is we are modeling what we are observing on silicon into equations okay so the one way to model it is by using say vdsat yes another person would say that oh what i will do is i will still call pinch off at vgs minus vt what i will do is i will start to change mobility from here okay i will call it as musat a new short channel whatever okay we are changing new so it is about models a more accurate model would say vdsat but if that book that you read tells you that mobility is dependent on short channel or long channel that is not actually correct physically mobility doesn't change with channel length mobility is the behavior of silicon yes but that book says i will want to model it with mobility let it not run it is a way of modelling okay and reality mobility cannot change yes the behavior of silicon is it not yes it will be same for you yeah so if someone is saying that there is an inaccuracy there but we can't even say it is wrong because that is the way they modeled it that is the way they modeled this curve but is there different ways of modeling that's it okay okay yes so you see these two curves look so similar in a short channel long channel yeah sir in transition when we talk about the saturation resistor is that due to that when radius it becomes equals to overdrive voltage or it is due to that velocity saturation so uh in short channel devices it is because of velocity saturation in long channel devices we say that pinch-off happens and that is why saturation happens okay thank you okay yeah so uh you know we look at these two curves you know they look so similar but now look at the y-axis scale yeah yes look at the y-axis over here it's gone up till 6 and over here it is at 2.5 this is what velocity saturation has done because current could not even grow to that level of pinch-off voltage are you able to see this yes so look at it over here i would say that saturation happens at almost vds of 1 volts over here the saturation is coming at 1.5 so this extra current that was appearing because of increased electric field and therefore increased electron velocity that has not happened okay so similarly in short channel and long channel devices the way it would reflect an igs vds igs id vgs curve is that you will see that long channel device this quad this is quadratic behavior through and through whereas in short channel devices it's quadratic behavior earlier but then it tends to be linear okay so when you have short channel devices your models also become more complex okay and emos is similar you just change the you know you you just change the voltages to be negative so it would appear like this the the flow of current is the flow of charges is from uh drain to source now and and so on okay so pmos exactly the same thing same thing applies just realize it's a dual it's the opposite of what we talked about in the nmos and what is what happens you're talking of linear and quadratic in the super threshold region what happens in the subthreshold region so you have a question yes sir about that shorthand and all can we say that uh first driving same amount of current i need a wider short channel device and i can use a less less width of long channel device to drive the same current yeah to have the same,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTafhAtqi6w,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTafhAtqi6w

question yes sir about that shorthand and all can we say that uh first driving same amount of current i need a wider short channel device and i can use a less less width of long channel device to drive the same current yeah to have the same"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,49fHN0JaBEU,current you will now need a larger device yes so what happens in the substantial region so sub-threshold region also there is some current flowing is it not yes sub threshold region also there is some current flowing super threshold region that is above vt we saw that okay it remains quadratic for some time then it goes linear what happens in the sub threshold region the subthreshold region the current changes exponentially you remember this equation the diode current and the slope the slope that we have in this region is called as sub threshold slope this s sir hello yes sir uh i mean like in uh during this condition sir if bgs is uh less than vt then there would be a depletion region right there won't be any kind of inversion layers such that id flows i'm that that's a doubt sir so you tell me can can there be no flow of current in our depletion region uh regarding to the equations and considering the equations i think there shouldn't be any kind of no no forget about equations again sorry so you should not learn it backwards okay so sir my doubt is that let us say there is a pn junction okay let us say there's a pn junction and you're applying two different voltages on the other side between gate and body or uh waves are exactly p and junction you tell me in a mosfet player as a pn junction sir actually if you talk about the current then uh current flow then we should talk about the source and source inversion layer and the drain right so when you made the source you will form a depletion region yes sir yes sir when you make a drain you will form a depletion region yes that is what we saw in the previous slide also now that these new new depletion regions start to appear as arsenal you made those sources yes sir so whenever there is this pn junction so these are pn junctions is it not yes but they won't be evident as bodies at low voltage i'm like they are reversed by asked to be precise yeah but is there no reverse bias current they're always reverse biased yes do not we do not ever want to have those pn junctions powered by us yes sir okay yes but there is a reverse bias current okay okay sir i do understand that's it but what is this exactly current flow between source and drain or source sorry drain and body it could be both over here we are talking about sub threshold current means start flow from source to drain okay sir okay but in reality leakage will happen everywhere okay so because this slide is on sub threshold conduction over here we are talking about current that charge that would flow from source to the drain okay i know that there is there is a depletion rate in a pn junction on the source there is also a pn junction on the drain and there is a depletion region in between them yes sir so that depletion region is all connected so if some electrons enter into this depletion region they will be at once pulled towards the drain is it not yes sir that might happen i'm like the minority charge so that is what the sub threshold conduction is about that even when you are not at vt there is some band bending happening there is some depletion region and therefore there will be some flow of current yes sir okay cycle i have a doubt from the previous slide of short channel the current sorry the current is decreased like why is it decreasing current is uh charge flow per unit time so in short channel like charge velocity saturation of electric field that you will probably not even observe okay velocity saturation has a behavior of silicon so but the electric fields were never so high that you would observe it on a long channel device so uh so like is it like a velocity saturation velocity saturation v1 velocity saturation v2 v1 is when the electric field goes that high velocity would saturate yes in long channel devices electric field doesn't reach there what is electric field it is uh delta v by l your length is large so electric field is low okay okay or channel devices length is reduced so electric field goes high okay so okay yes sir so uh yes um i really didn't understand this uh sub threshold um conduction part i mean how are we getting that exponential graph and then how it varies okay so it's not again we observe this one silicon we realize it is exponential and then we model it okay because as uh gagamdeep said it's like it's almost like you know uh pn junction right but i'm confused as to where a pn junction will be formed because there's a before vt there's a depletion region right between wait wait wait depreciation region oh no no no no where would a depletion region be formed so there is a is it not so this is a pn junction is it not yes similarly there's a pn junction here yeah and then depending on gate voltage there is a depletion region here yeah if this depletion region is very less let us say that the gate voltage is such that the separation region is very less they'll be very minuscule conduction of current because even if electrons enter here they will exit from here there is a very large region where they could exit from okay into the body now you increase the gate voltage depletion region became large right now most electrons will move from here to here okay okay and that that relationship is exponential in nature depletion region and huge surge of electrons moving from the source region to the drain region okay uh but so this is a id versus bgs right so this should be the you know slope should be pointing upwards when you're if you're leaving here getting vd fixed and you're increasing vgs you're increasing the overdrive so i mean in long channel devices it grows in a quadratic manner right yeah so here i'm assuming this is for a short channel device is it yes so i mean it has a very different behavior like um because it's i mean the slope is decreasing how so i mean huh because initially the change of charge or change of current is exponential then it goes quadratic then velocity saturation happens it becomes linear the slope has to degrade uh okay okay yeah yeah yeah sorry we're confused all right you're saying the same thing yeah so this is logarithmic axis right yes that is why exponential looks to be linear yes sir this this leakage sir it will be completely dependent on vds now it is dependent on exponentially this substrate leakage this thing will be completely dependent on vgs so whatever this vds not vgs vds so that is what i am telling you it is also dependent on vgs so that is how that is the behavior because the depletion region so there was this this depletion region there was this depletion region if my vds is negative that is i do not have any depletion layer then there is no connection between these two there will be no vd no id okay as soon as i increase vds what happens depletion region starts to become there so electron that enters into this depletion region rushes there yes earlier there was no such path so when there was no such facts there would be no nothing so vgs were dependent sugar if this vds is low this path is this region through which electrons can move from here to here is lesser current would be lesser yes so there is a dependence on vdf so basically at uh in this graph one thing so basically we want low heating uh uh because more leakage will occur due to low heat so according to we want more leakage like we want less leakage so that's why we should be near to the highest your vt should be as high as possible so that when your gate is at zero you have as low current as possible but in advance technologies you will see that technologies because you want speed and you want to lower the vdd of operation you go to lower vts so the curve would would become something like this okay okay additionally see let us say this is this this is the device if i say that my sub threshold slope goes bad what happens if my sub threshold slope goes bad then i will have lower sub threshold current so we want a sub threshold slope such that within 60 millivolts which is the limit of silicon within 60 millivolts you should be able to reduce current by one decade so this should be 60 millivolts okay but in reality it is anywhere between 70 to 100. the lower it is the better that technology is but there are other reasons because of which it cannot really come to 60 60 is a theoretical limit for silicon okay um so yeah but i'm still a little bit confused in the previous slide um can you show me the like the small length um it's more in small channel yeah so there you i mean it's much quadratic than linear and this is id versus bgs right and then uh in the graph for sub threshold it's the slope is decreasing quadratic and then linear so look at this this is exponential axis there's a logarithmic axis there okay this is right uh okay okay okay okay this is logarithmic axis and that was linear access right right fine okay okay so yes sir in the sub threshold when you were discussing threshold you said that when we were going towards like higher than higher notes then the basically that there we were getting the changes so that we were not basically reducing the sub threshold or the leakage currents basically so like does it mean that we cannot escape that kind of phenomena because you said that the graph is shifting upward that way it was cutting the like this id access the y-axis it is moving up you showed that yeah so so we wish i showed something like this that the slope is not good yeah yes sir so so i mean like even if you're going towards that if you reduce the vt then also we cannot escape this kind of phenomena basically somehow it somehow it just jumps back and we get the same kind of effect yeah so leakage is a very major issue in advanced technologies okay okay so earlier we used to think that if we reduce the bt we would reduce the leakage but it is not happening that way vt reduction would also always lead to increase in leakage so vd reduction would increase the leakage yes what does vt reduction mean vt direction means that i will shift this entire curve a little more on this side right okay okay i i didn't think of in shifting terms i was thinking like reducing vt means shifting it now okay right so it means it will hit it at a higher current so leakage would definitely increase as you increase the as you decrease the vp okay so the more speed i am going towards then i'm getting the more leakage kind of thing okay okay okay thank you sir okay so this is in the same technology if you reduce beauty this will happen what i'm saying is if the technology is bad then even with the same vt you can actually end up having higher leakage so this i cannot understand it with this even the same technology how what exactly this is this is a different technology so a technology has a characteristic sub threshold slope okay okay if you change the technology the slope would change okay so i have same vt but due to short channel effects due to punch through whatever reasons huh due to various reasons i will have a different slope so so these different red curves are basically different technology nodes right yes and having the same bt kind of thing technology nodes it could be 65 nanometer technology only but one could be from tsmc another would be from global foundation another one could be from samsung okay so though they are having the same vt but this sub threshold characteristic characterization different okay so whenever you look at technology you can not just look at vtk you also need to look at how is the leakage moving because that gives you the substantial slope estimate and so i really want that if this 66 within the 60 kind of change we want this yeah i really want one decade reduction within 60 millivolts because silicon okay okay excuse me yeah so i still didn't get why we are having a contracted baby and then [Music] yeah so what happens uh let us go back to the earlier curves so igs this is vgs id characteristic okay for a given vds in saturations yes so we are talking about vds which is saturation vds which is greater than vgs minus vt so in long channel devices as you increased vgs the behavior was quadratic in short channel devices it remains quadratic for a little while but then it becomes becomes linear okay sir and so what was the reason for this uh one reason is velocity saturation but there are other reasons also but we can't we i don't want to go into those details otherwise we will get digressed too too much that is what i'm noticing with this class which is i'm happy because you're learning more things but then we need to progress in terms of syllabus also okay so you can you can use the reference book and you will be able to find out details are there also so that is on the end of this class okay okay so i think it's already 120 we can close the class now uh any questions yes so i have one request to make can i let's handle that question first yeah yes sir i was asking that sir in uh older technologies we when we were not going to very low voltages at that point of time this subtraction current would not really be something that we could was worried about right i mean yeah and and older technologies uh the vt was also very high point seven point eight volt vp so even if the slope was bad the leakage current would be low additionally older technologies the total number of devices that you can put on silicon is also low is also less so total leakage never bothered us an advanced as we are integrating more devices onto the same die and each of those devices is also leaking more because of advanced technology note leakage is a major issue or low power for low power and portable devices leakage is a major issue so we have many schemes as we will look at later in the course also to reduce leakage leakage recovery is a special task that is done when you design chips okay some kind of implants and all this yeah you will see that in videos yes father you you wanted to say something yes sir so it is about the quiz like a quiz for two lectures would be better uh and uh in between them your office are will be a good like will clarify our doubt then we'll move to quiz then it would be better and if you're trying to have a quiz on wednesday or friday next week like then we'll have one more lecture our doubts will not be clarified and like so we'll have it at eight pm on monday don't worry yeah yeah okay then it's okay htm on monday is fine with everyone i believe yes sir i had a question only regarding velocity saturation thing so like we i understood that because of the velocity saturation in the short channel we are not able to achieve the kind of current which we were in the long channel so but the current according to as i also visualize current depends upon the number of charge cases right so even if i am getting the same amount of charge carriers even at a very low kind of voltage then the current i should be able to achieve that kind of like peak like that kind of like voltage current level i mean electric field is it does depend on the number of charge carriers or also on their velocity no so it depends upon the velocity but still if i am able to like achieve the kind of numbers uh like in the terms of density then i'm able even if i'm getting them uh like i'm achieving the velocity higher velocity lower at if we increase the width of the device we will be able to do it okay okay like the deep said okay okay okay okay but then we don't want to increase the size,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49fHN0JaBEU,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49fHN0JaBEU
Transcript: current you will now need a larger device yes so what happens in the substantial region so sub-threshold region also there is some current flowing is it not yes sub threshold region also there is some current flowing super threshold region that is above vt we saw that okay it remains quadratic for some time then it goes linear what happens in the sub threshold region the subthreshold region the current changes exponentially you remember this equation the diode current and the slope the slope that we have in this region is called as sub threshold slope this s sir hello yes sir uh i mean like in uh during this condition sir if bgs is uh less than vt then there would be a depletion region right there won't be any kind of inversion layers such that id flows i'm that that's a doubt sir so you tell me can can there be no flow of current in our depletion region uh regarding to the equations and considering the equations i think there shouldn't be any kind of no no forget about equations again sorry so you should not learn it backwards okay so sir my doubt is that let us say there is a pn junction okay let us say there's a pn junction and you're applying two different voltages on the other side between gate and body or uh waves are exactly p and junction you tell me in a mosfet player as a pn junction sir actually if you talk about the current then uh current flow then we should talk about the source and source inversion layer and the drain right so when you made the source you will form a depletion region yes sir yes sir when you make a drain you will form a depletion region yes that is what we saw in the previous slide also now that these new new depletion regions start to appear as arsenal you made those sources yes sir so whenever there is this pn junction so these are pn junctions is it not yes but they won't be evident as bodies at low voltage i'm like they are reversed by asked to be precise yeah but is there no reverse bias current they're always reverse biased yes do not we do not ever want to have those pn junctions powered by us yes sir okay yes but there is a reverse bias current okay okay sir i do understand that's it but what is this exactly current flow between source and drain or source sorry drain and body it could be both over here we are talking about sub threshold current means start flow from source to drain okay sir okay but in reality leakage will happen everywhere okay so because this slide is on sub threshold conduction over here we are talking about current that charge that would flow from source to the drain okay i know that there is there is a depletion rate in a pn junction on the source there is also a pn junction on the drain and there is a depletion region in between them yes sir so that depletion region is all connected so if some electrons enter into this depletion region they will be at once pulled towards the drain is it not yes sir that might happen i'm like the minority charge so that is what the sub threshold conduction is about that even when you are not at vt there is some band bending happening there is some depletion region and therefore there will be some flow of current yes sir okay cycle i have a doubt from the previous slide of short channel the current sorry the current is decreased like why is it decreasing current is uh charge flow per unit time so in short channel like charge velocity saturation of electric field that you will probably not even observe okay velocity saturation has a behavior of silicon so but the electric fields were never so high that you would observe it on a long channel device so uh so like is it like a velocity saturation velocity saturation v1 velocity saturation v2 v1 is when the electric field goes that high velocity would saturate yes in long channel devices electric field doesn't reach there what is electric field it is uh delta v by l your length is large so electric field is low okay okay or channel devices length is reduced so electric field goes high okay so okay yes sir so uh yes um i really didn't understand this uh sub threshold um conduction part i mean how are we getting that exponential graph and then how it varies okay so it's not again we observe this one silicon we realize it is exponential and then we model it okay because as uh gagamdeep said it's like it's almost like you know uh pn junction right but i'm confused as to where a pn junction will be formed because there's a before vt there's a depletion region right between wait wait wait depreciation region oh no no no no where would a depletion region be formed so there is a is it not so this is a pn junction is it not yes similarly there's a pn junction here yeah and then depending on gate voltage there is a depletion region here yeah if this depletion region is very less let us say that the gate voltage is such that the separation region is very less they'll be very minuscule conduction of current because even if electrons enter here they will exit from here there is a very large region where they could exit from okay into the body now you increase the gate voltage depletion region became large right now most electrons will move from here to here okay okay and that that relationship is exponential in nature depletion region and huge surge of electrons moving from the source region to the drain region okay uh but so this is a id versus bgs right so this should be the you know slope should be pointing upwards when you're if you're leaving here getting vd fixed and you're increasing vgs you're increasing the overdrive so i mean in long channel devices it grows in a quadratic manner right yeah so here i'm assuming this is for a short channel device is it yes so i mean it has a very different behavior like um because it's i mean the slope is decreasing how so i mean huh because initially the change of charge or change of current is exponential then it goes quadratic then velocity saturation happens it becomes linear the slope has to degrade uh okay okay yeah yeah yeah sorry we're confused all right you're saying the same thing yeah so this is logarithmic axis right yes that is why exponential looks to be linear yes sir this this leakage sir it will be completely dependent on vds now it is dependent on exponentially this substrate leakage this thing will be completely dependent on vgs so whatever this vds not vgs vds so that is what i am telling you it is also dependent on vgs so that is how that is the behavior because the depletion region so there was this this depletion region there was this depletion region if my vds is negative that is i do not have any depletion layer then there is no connection between these two there will be no vd no id okay as soon as i increase vds what happens depletion region starts to become there so electron that enters into this depletion region rushes there yes earlier there was no such path so when there was no such facts there would be no nothing so vgs were dependent sugar if this vds is low this path is this region through which electrons can move from here to here is lesser current would be lesser yes so there is a dependence on vdf so basically at uh in this graph one thing so basically we want low heating uh uh because more leakage will occur due to low heat so according to we want more leakage like we want less leakage so that's why we should be near to the highest your vt should be as high as possible so that when your gate is at zero you have as low current as possible but in advance technologies you will see that technologies because you want speed and you want to lower the vdd of operation you go to lower vts so the curve would would become something like this okay okay additionally see let us say this is this this is the device if i say that my sub threshold slope goes bad what happens if my sub threshold slope goes bad then i will have lower sub threshold current so we want a sub threshold slope such that within 60 millivolts which is the limit of silicon within 60 millivolts you should be able to reduce current by one decade so this should be 60 millivolts okay but in reality it is anywhere between 70 to 100. the lower it is the better that technology is but there are other reasons because of which it cannot really come to 60 60 is a theoretical limit for silicon okay um so yeah but i'm still a little bit confused in the previous slide um can you show me the like the small length um it's more in small channel yeah so there you i mean it's much quadratic than linear and this is id versus bgs right and then uh in the graph for sub threshold it's the slope is decreasing quadratic and then linear so look at this this is exponential axis there's a logarithmic axis there okay this is right uh okay okay okay okay this is logarithmic axis and that was linear access right right fine okay okay so yes sir in the sub threshold when you were discussing threshold you said that when we were going towards like higher than higher notes then the basically that there we were getting the changes so that we were not basically reducing the sub threshold or the leakage currents basically so like does it mean that we cannot escape that kind of phenomena because you said that the graph is shifting upward that way it was cutting the like this id access the y-axis it is moving up you showed that yeah so so we wish i showed something like this that the slope is not good yeah yes sir so so i mean like even if you're going towards that if you reduce the vt then also we cannot escape this kind of phenomena basically somehow it somehow it just jumps back and we get the same kind of effect yeah so leakage is a very major issue in advanced technologies okay okay so earlier we used to think that if we reduce the bt we would reduce the leakage but it is not happening that way vt reduction would also always lead to increase in leakage so vd reduction would increase the leakage yes what does vt reduction mean vt direction means that i will shift this entire curve a little more on this side right okay okay i i didn't think of in shifting terms i was thinking like reducing vt means shifting it now okay right so it means it will hit it at a higher current so leakage would definitely increase as you increase the as you decrease the vp okay so the more speed i am going towards then i'm getting the more leakage kind of thing okay okay okay thank you sir okay so this is in the same technology if you reduce beauty this will happen what i'm saying is if the technology is bad then even with the same vt you can actually end up having higher leakage so this i cannot understand it with this even the same technology how what exactly this is this is a different technology so a technology has a characteristic sub

technology only but one could be from tsmc another would be from global foundation another one could be from samsung okay so though they are having the same vt but this sub threshold characteristic characterization different okay so whenever you look at technology you can not just look at vtk you also need to look at how is the leakage moving because that gives you the substantial slope estimate and so i really want that if this 66 within the 60 kind of change we want this yeah i really want one decade reduction within 60 millivolts because silicon okay okay excuse me yeah so i still didn't get why we are having a contracted baby and then [Music] yeah so what happens uh let us go back to the earlier curves so igs this is vgs id characteristic okay for a given vds in saturations yes so we are talking about vds which is saturation vds which is greater than vgs minus vt so in long channel devices as you increased vgs the behavior was quadratic in short channel devices it remains

if you're trying to have a quiz on wednesday or friday next week like then we'll have one more lecture our doubts will not be clarified and like so we'll have it at eight pm on monday don't worry yeah

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,vqkD13iBp8U,thank you sir yeah so let's move to today's class now so we've looked at mass capacitances and we looked at mosfet also has a capacitance where we said that the high frequency behavior and low frequency behavior of a mosfet capacitance would be same you remember this we talked about this not just in the last class but also in the office hours and at in much at much length and much detail so why is that the case because there is a source and drain region which is a you know cache of charges right next there so if you if you need more more uh electrons or holes whatever you need you will get them from that region so even at even at very high frequency uh the change in charge density would happen only in the inversion layer but then this this still now is about the gate capacitance in reality mosfets have many more capacitances mosfet transistors yeah mosfet is a transistor so mosfets has many more capacitances are you able to relate to this perspective view of a mosfet yes so where all do you think you will have capacitances when you look at the 3d structure so we have some overlap capacitances of gate and source create and drain and then we'll have some junction capacitances from source to body and from brain to body are there any other capacitances here wherever there is a change in medium sir i'm like whenever there is a change in medium then we would have some capacitance over there okay so contact yeah depletion capacitances we already also mentioned that the source and uh drains will have their junctions and that junction would lead to capacitance that is what you're talking about the same as the mass capacitance that we've already discussed that length it's apart from them okay so you're saying that there is a another capacitance that appears from ground from gate to body from inversion to body but that is the same medium how can there be a capacitance between inversion layer and the body that is all silicon anything there is to flow it will flow but current flow can happen if there so between inversion and and the silicon body there is no capacitance cannot be because they are connected charge will flow start flows so if the inversion layer is not there so don't get confused if the inversion layer is not there then we say that gate 2 silicon surface and silicon surface to edge of depletion there are two capacitances in series yes but at that point there is no inversion layer there cannot be a capacitance between inversion layer and the edge of the depletion region because they are electrically connected okay okay so yes yeah i mean um adding to martha's point i didn't understand that if there can be a capacitance between your source and your substrate because of the same reason during the existence of a depletion region then why can't there be a capacitance between your inversion there which is electric and the substrate the source and the substrate are different dopings there is a depletion junction in between them yeah okay if there is no inversion layer then then all all the silicon is same doping there is a depletion layer right but then how are we doing differently okay for a capacitance there need to be two plates yes separated by a dielectric yeah i know where you could apply two independent voltages at two different plates and then they are separated by a dielectric yes so uh if there is a if there is no inversion layer okay where is the plate and if there is an inversion layer there is anywhere connection there is a connection yeah okay so so uh yeah that i got that when there's no inversion there just a depletion region so effectively there are capacitors in series so you uh the effect is that your capacitance gets lower but um so see when there is an inversion layer then the the body the uh region of the uh the region of the substrate right beneath the plate acts like uh right between this uh right beneath the silicon dioxide acts as a an n-type substrate right that's the point of it is just a layer it is just a sheet of electrons that starts to appear there okay so we cannot compare your source and then green with the inversion that are two very different things yes okay okay so if we look at the top level view of the mosfet then this is how it would drop and that is the overlap region and the overlap capacitance that doesn't be mentioned that beneath the grid there is an overlap capacitance but in reality let us say there is a contact over here there will be a gate to contact capacitance and there will be lines of electric field which would run between gate poly vertical poly and the active region the diffusion region so what does this mean this essentially means that in a mosfet there is a capacitance cgb gate and body there is a capacitance between so between gate and source and gate and brain and there is a capacitance between see source and body and brain and body are you able to appreciate all these capacitances yes sir yes ragas so in the previous slide only uh the previous ones are can you move there so this electric field that you're talking about uh between the poly and the drain which is coming out i mean the electric field should be uh in the in the overlapping region right but why what is this overlapping region so diffusion capacitances that you just know the overlap capacity you talked about no that is just one component of gate to drain capacitance that is what i wanted to highlight talked about just one component which is the overlap capacitance but there is this other component of capacitance between gate and drain which would come with the gate to contact coupling and the gate to a diffusion layer coupling so this diffusion layer coupling i'm not able to get exactly what exactly there is a dielectric here let us remove this this is always dielectric this is supposedly a metal metal equivalent because this is drain there is this metal equivalent which is uh poly so there are two metals in between there is a dielectric there will be lines of forces between them so what kind of dielectric will be between this and not silicon dioxide so but that is the gate of light is that that is again everywhere is the silicon dioxide what do you think what do you think is there nothing is there air between these two i mean so places didn't had an idea about this so this all the silicon dioxide we talked about oxidation now yeah okay so we're coming in we talked about oxidation see again i am repeating the same thing again which i repeated in the last session that whatever we talked about whether it was fabrication so why do you think i'm answering all these questions which supposedly should be answered and answered in ssd and not in dvd why do you think i'm taking you through all this so you're trying to connect may be different no because you need to realize that unless you understand things from the very basics you cannot become a good circuit designer also each one of those aspects that we have covered in the class till now whether it was the design flow and hundreds of questions you asked around the design flow or whether it was the fabrication flow and the so many questions you asked around the fabrication flow or this band bending and everything all of this you need to understand to be able to use transistors effectively and become a good circuit designer this course is about circuit design therefore these are the incoming inputs then you need this this kind of knowledge don't assume that it was an independent topic introduction no i would rather not have given that introduction if it was not needed for this course right right so okay so sir so so this gate to drain capacitance in the model that was consisting of this overlap and this also this uh yeah coupling the other coupling this total cgd would have both components in it the overlap capacitance and the gate the polygate to metal and to contact and propagate to diffusion layer capacitance everything will be there and the total cgd so just one more thing in the gate to drain we are we are basically comprising three capacitances right so overlap contact and this above the diffusion layer yes and same goes for the gate to source also yes yes so similarly gate to body you know in different reasons for for example if there is inversion layer then the real body capacitance is something but if your device is off then the body capacitance could be something else yes sir that's the most capacity because the depletion layer would also come into picture there so what whatever components would come would come when we say cgd you should mentally or be able to relate oh all these three things would contribute to the capacitance so if i tell you that my friend please reduce pgd what would you do as a designer can you control this i don't think so sir no but as a designer you can control the spacing between contact and this as a designer you can control the overall diffusion region so as a designer you can reduce the density of contacts and therefore you can control the poly two positive quality drain uh polytube contact or let us say gate to drain capacitance so what do you mean by the density of contact this is mentioned we will see once we look at the layout have we just pop this okay okay so this is the top let us be there so this is the top level view of the device poly and source engine so i can make multiple contacts over here yes sir so if i say that no i will not make two contacts i will make one contact i will reduce the capacitance now because i have reduced the area right so that was what i meant by reducing the number of contacts so as a designer you can do this so until you understand that all these three components exist you will not be able to handle the design the requirements of the design effectively okay so do not think that this is only theory there is a clear application of what we are talking about okay so i can reduce the number of contacts that is the between the three components i have only have a one component which i can play with and and i also said you can reduce the drain region the the drain area so it's a drain area i can reduce now because that is this device i can say oh i will just make it this big i will not extend rain unnecessarily so i mean drain as they made some layouts it is dependent on the active region right yeah yeah so activation you can keep it to the minimum width now not just let it run hundreds of miles so but that is basically controlled by the sizing that we have that we want to achieve this extension i'm talking about okay so i'm not i'm not aware of this parameter right yeah so we will see you will become aware pretty soon you made the layouts now in the assignment also you're making layouts yes sir so but this is not aware of this extension so i'm not controlling this because actually so i mean the bit time controlling so it is oh you're using p cells to design your layouts right you're using t cells to design your layouts you're invoking a pmos and an nmos directly then you're automatically giving away the control that you would have had to the tool none you make the layout by hand maybe the active region makes a poly you will have all the control so right right now when we have done the schematic then we do like generate from source and we get pmos involved so don't do that okay who said generate from sources only way open a virtuoso window and make the active and make the poly you have all the controls so how will you control you're giving away a lever a design lever okay okay so we can keep it to the like the minimum brc that would enable it yeah yeah so you have two levers you thought you had none okay okay so that will basically minimize that over that uh basically the coupling one the gate to drain coupling if it is this yeah see the overlap you have no control over overlap capacitance is a technology feature fabrication because that is that is what is required to ensure there is some bt some whatever that you cannot control okay but whatever you can control at least you should be aware of that right right yes okay yes so this is how the uh gate and the various capacitances you know are kind of seen over here where we say that the sea gate is eox by t-ox into width of the device into length of the device this is clear sir yes sir a small question sir so while you were mentioning about the uh pins on the drain and the gate you said that there might be more than one pin i'm like why are we yeah sorry contact my bad so uh why are we taking more than one contract sir actually i'm like uh firstly why are we taking more than one contract and why are we okay you do a pcell you make a pizza and make a device of width for two microns see how many contacts it will give you yeah sir actually i have made that but but uh in the it has given many contacts that i'm like uh that that was my daughter that's what i'm saying remove them i'm like i should remove those not all of them few of them you mean to say i have to connect them by each other or something sir remove them what does remove mean does remove mean connect no not as such sir uh okay sorry use only what is needed okay sir okay thank you sir i'll try it now why are four needed why is the one not sufficient actually that was my doubt daughter i'm like i didn't know why are we i'm like specified about the number of contacts exactly i'm like why are we even uh looking into it exactly you tell me what are contacts they are they are kind of buyers connecting the metal one with the source or the drain yes sir yes sir so if you have one wire versus you have four wires in parallel what happens okay resistance decreases i don't thank you sir okay so uh what is being shown over here is that as vgs changes as vds changes there is a diff you you can actually end up seeing different capacitance on the gate why is that so the above graph seems to be of the mass capacitor itself yes we've already done all of this okay shows the depletion region being formed and therefore the change of charges happening at the boundary of the depletion region and as soon as the inversion layer comes independent of frequency we at once have high capacitance so what is this lower graph then this these are the two components this is uh the gate coupling with body because depletion region was coming into picture and as soon as the inversion layer is formed there is no further coupling between body and gate now the additional charge comes from source and drain regions remember in the inversion layer we said that in in devices in mosfets the source and and drain will give the additional charge even at very high frequency okay so but in the lower frequency the in when the inversion is forming the charge is coming from the body itself is it then you see you see we've already shown it like this that it is coming from source and brain it is closer now it is showing that when dt has speech i think so then it's coming from source entry so this is the vt point like this so this this line is the vp point you see already this capacitance has started to rise before that what does that mean the charge the inversion is forming due to the source entry yes so since lower graph is just basically elaborating that way that confidence their components this is comp there are various components this is capacitance with bulk this is capacitance with source this is capacitance with drain it's saying that all the three components add up to form cdc gate capacitance and source and drain they have equal coupling because of equal overlap and equal density of charges there therefore this is double overall cdc is double of cgs and cgd so but this ggs is basically due to the overlap right or is it also like all the three ones is because of all three now okay sir uh in this first graph sir sir uh here uh this gate to source and gate to drain both are becoming after uh this vgs is greater than vt so they are becoming half sir uh is this because of the uniform channel formation yes because vds is kept at zero okay so after this in this sir uh this saturate nothing is told about the saturation that is the second graph that is the graph on the right side so if the if we uh increase the v this vds so this vg cs vgs and vgd both will become two by three in case in the first no the due to pinch off the drain will have no influence therefore the gate to drain capacitance goes towards zero okay and this gate to source become will become two by three will increase yes yes okay okay in the same graph yeah yeah this one no no starting the left one in the left one vds is equal to zero so yes so suppose at the end of this graph if the first graph we start increasing vds so then what will happen to vg uh vgs and that is that is what we have done over here no we started in this existing videos that is what happened so that's the continuation of it okay yes notice same points here wlc so here it would actually depend on other factors also known so yeah yeah yeah that is where the graphs are there uh yeah sir this was uh this refers to before so you told us about the three components uh i got the contact capacitance and the coupling capacitance uh that's fine but um didn't quite understand the diffusion level capacitance you talked about we will come to that welcome to that okay and uh second question is in this graph you see uh we are seeing the components uh gcs gcd and gc bulk um but yeah i mean when we had started to mosque capacitance um we were only in a sense i mean from what i understood we were only looking at the um gate to bulk because there was no source order in there yeah but here we see that the gate to bulk capacitance keeps decreasing it vanishes so it decreases for uh for a mass capacitance also now that is where we end up with the depletion region where we go to wd mass and we say this is the minimum capacitance you would have yeah yeah but donating pieces right but in this only in low frequency only low frequency then this change is happening in the inversion layer again but then sir i mean even at high frequency then it after one point it remains constant but that is low that is a low value that's that's low but um in this case it we just see it it just keeps on decreasing until it vanishes so uh okay and but this now starts to come from source and drain region therefore gate capacitance comes up okay so when you're talking about the bulk you're talking about the substituting the lot between inversion here and no no no no no no okay okay okay so now we come to the diffusion capacitance that was what you were asking hey what is happening in the diffusion capacitance so can i you are explaining this i want to ask about the right words graph the graph in the right side i i was not able to understand that yeah tell me so uh here we are we were saying the gcd is decreasing and gcs is increasing why is that so certain uh because pen shop has happened so the drain is no longer connected to the inversion layer okay the drain can no longer so when you change the gate voltage there is no longer any change in the charge towards the drain yes sir that is why that's where cjd goes to zero okay and the source side we have the charge density that is why it is increasing yes now all the charge needs to come from the source side only therefore the component or the value of cgcs increases okay okay okay but because pinch-off has happened the overall inversion layer width has reduced inversion layer availability has reduced therefore the overall capacitance is reduced okay okay so now coming to the diffusion capacitance are you able to see this tub over here i'm calling this a tub because this actually looks like a bathtub or a tub for that matter which is where we have uh doped n plus for the source ordering region let us say now if i say that this is one plate there is a pn junction on all the sides of this plate are you able to see this yes sir all the sides except this one why because depletion depletion yes because the channel is there there's an inversion layer that you're talking about okay if there was no inversion layer then it would come on this side also but in a on device they say there is an inversion layer so this this will not appear so if i want to find the capacitance of this drain or the source what happens i have to measure the capacitance on the side walls and i have to measure the capacitance of the bottom tub bottom bottom of the tub are you able to see this so but the sidewalls is like uh on the side walls you have the dioxide right uh sidewalls you have the okay so let us look at very weird so side walls you have this isolation yes but this there this is there now okay okay so yeah didn't notice okay sir yes so on the channel side the inversion is just at the surface but i have got that wd max so that would also come now because it's not wd max is there so i will get that on that side even though there is a depletion layer there is no other end of the plate because of the channel and the depletion layer so let us look at it like this over here what is what are we saying there is a depletion layer over here and then there is a rotation layer wd max over here and then the source comes so yeah yes sir so where is the other plate now so the substrate for itself will be other plate that is too far away from here and then from the inversion layer and so many places so is it like that it is becoming like negligible kind of thing because of the capacitance so capacitance of uh this part of the plate to this part of the plate it has it is it is such a big long path the dielectric thickness is so long the oxygenated depth is so big that the capacitance is insignificant in comparison to what you will see over here okay okay okay so what do we do we say that okay let us measure the the perimeter and then multiply it with the number which is cj c junction sidewall okay and let us measure the area that is the extension and the width okay so this is ls the extension and the width that will give me the area of the bottom rectangle and i multiply that with c junction and with this i get the entire the overall capacitance of the the diffusion capacitance of the drain or the source region now again if i want to reduce the drain or source capacitance what do i need to do width is fixed but i can reduce the ls are you able to see this so so this diffusion capacitance is the gate 2 ball gate tools i source drain 2 bulk and the source this is yeah in the model yeah and so one more thing say in the junction capacitance of the uh like side walls the the base this x j parameter coming into picture it should also be enough for the parameters we had it only two ls plus w yeah so you will say that c j into x j becomes c j as w ok ok because substance over here you know the depth and based on that you came up with this value of cjsw okay and so one more thing so this ls component will have that overlap component also right because that is there right or it will be subtracted yeah ls would be the entire train region whether it is below the gate or not below the gate if there is okay uh sir so you said that diffusion capacitance is a is a component of your gate to source or gate to grain capacitance but in this case it's it seems like it's a component of your uh so i mean source to bulk no oh oh so i did not say diffusion capacitance i said gate capacitance with the diffusion region okay what i meant was those extra lines of this was am i audible yes sir yeah this was gate capacitance with the diffusion region okay okay the diffusion capacitance when we use the term diffusion capacitance this is what is the diffusion capacitance that we're talking about okay yeah so the diffusion time is coming because that because of the fabrication thing right because we should diffuse the because initially the source and train regions were diffused okay that's why it is coming today they are implanted today the iron implantation is done at an earlier point of time phostine was run through and diffusion happened so that is why we called it diffusion layer so put on okay so now we come to

Transcript: thank you sir yeah so let's move to today's class now so we've looked at mass capacitances and we looked at mosfet also has a capacitance where we said that the high frequency behavior and low frequency behavior of a mosfet capacitance would be same you remember this we talked about this not just in the last class but also in the office hours and at in much at much length and much detail so why is that the case because there is a source and drain region which is a you know cache of charges right next there so if you if you need more more uh electrons or holes whatever you need you will get them from that region so even at even at very high frequency uh the change in charge density would happen only in the inversion layer but then this this still now is about the gate capacitance in reality mosfets have many more capacitances mosfet transistors yeah mosfet is a transistor so mosfets has many more capacitances are you able to relate to this perspective view of a mosfet yes so where all do you think you will have capacitances when you look at the 3d structure so we have some overlap capacitances of gate and source create and drain and then we'll have some junction capacitances from source to body and from brain to body are there any other capacitances here wherever there is a change in medium sir i'm like whenever there is a change in medium then we would have some capacitance over there okay so contact yeah depletion capacitances we already also mentioned that the source and uh drains will have their junctions and that junction would lead to capacitance that is what you're talking about the same as the mass capacitance that we've already discussed that length it's apart from them okay so you're saying that there is a another capacitance that appears from ground from gate to body from inversion to body but that is the same medium how can there be a capacitance between inversion layer and the body that is all silicon anything there is to flow it will flow but current flow can happen if there so between inversion and and the silicon body there is no capacitance cannot be because they are connected charge will flow start flows so if the inversion layer is not there so don't get confused if the inversion layer is not there then we say that gate 2 silicon surface and silicon surface to edge of depletion there are two capacitances in series yes but at that point there is no inversion layer there cannot be a capacitance between inversion layer and the edge of the depletion region because they are electrically connected okay okay so yes yeah i mean um adding to martha's point i didn't understand that if there can be a capacitance between your source and your substrate because of the same reason during the existence of a depletion region then why can't there be a capacitance between your inversion there which is electric and the substrate the source and the substrate are different dopings there is a depletion junction in between them yeah okay if there is no inversion layer then then all all the silicon is same doping there is a depletion layer right but then how are we doing differently okay for a capacitance there need to be two plates yes separated by a dielectric yeah i know where you could apply two independent voltages at two different plates and then they are separated by a dielectric yes so uh if there is a if there is no inversion layer okay where is the plate and if there is an inversion layer there is anywhere connection there is a connection yeah okay so so uh yeah that i got that when there's no inversion there just a depletion region so effectively there are capacitors in series so you uh the effect is that your capacitance gets lower but um so see when there is an inversion layer then the the body the uh region of the uh the region of the substrate right beneath the plate acts like uh right between this uh right beneath the silicon dioxide acts as a an n-type substrate right that's the point of it is just a layer it is just a sheet of electrons that starts to appear there okay so we cannot compare your source and then green with the inversion that are two very different things yes okay okay so if we look at the top level view of the mosfet then this is how it would drop and that is the overlap region and the overlap capacitance that doesn't be mentioned that beneath the grid there is an overlap capacitance but in reality let us say there is a contact over here there will be a gate to contact capacitance and there will be lines of electric field which would run between gate poly vertical poly and the active region the diffusion region so what does this mean this essentially means that in a mosfet there is a capacitance cgb gate and body there is a capacitance between so between gate and source and gate and brain and there is a capacitance between see source and body and brain and body are you able to appreciate all these capacitances yes sir yes ragas so in the previous slide only uh the previous ones are can you move there so this electric field that you're talking about uh between the poly and the drain which is coming out i mean the electric field should be uh in the in the overlapping region right but why what is this overlapping region so diffusion capacitances that you just know the overlap capacity you talked about no that is just one component of gate to drain capacitance that is what i wanted to highlight talked about just one component which is the overlap capacitance but there is this other component of capacitance between gate and drain which would come with the gate to contact coupling and the gate to a diffusion layer coupling so this diffusion layer coupling i'm not able to get exactly what exactly there is a dielectric here let us remove this this is always dielectric this is supposedly a metal metal equivalent because this is drain there is this metal equivalent which is uh poly so there are two metals in between there is a dielectric there will be lines of forces between them so what kind of dielectric will be between this and not silicon dioxide so but that is the gate of light is that that is again everywhere is the silicon dioxide what do you think what do you think is there nothing is there air between these two i mean so places didn't had an idea about this so this all the silicon dioxide we talked about oxidation now yeah okay so we're coming in we talked about oxidation see again i am repeating the same thing again which i repeated in the last session that whatever we talked about whether it was fabrication so why do you think i'm answering all these questions which supposedly should be answered and answered in ssd and not in dvd why do you think i'm taking you through all this so you're trying to connect may be different no because you need to realize that unless you understand things from the very basics you cannot become a good circuit designer also each one of those aspects that we have covered in the class till now whether it was the design flow and hundreds of questions you asked around the design flow or whether it was the fabrication flow and the so many questions you asked around the fabrication flow or this band bending and everything all of this you need to understand to be able to use transistors effectively and become a good circuit designer this course is about circuit design therefore these are the incoming inputs then you need this this kind of knowledge don't assume that it was an independent topic introduction no i would rather not have given that introduction if it was not needed for this course right right so okay so sir so so this gate to drain capacitance in the model that was consisting of this overlap and this also this uh yeah coupling the other coupling this total cgd would have both components in it the overlap capacitance and the gate the polygate to metal and to contact and propagate to diffusion layer capacitance everything will be there and the total cgd so just one more thing in the gate to drain we are we are basically comprising three capacitances right so overlap contact and this above the diffusion layer yes and same goes for the gate to source also yes yes so similarly gate to body you know in different reasons for for example if there is inversion layer then the real body capacitance is something but if your device is off then the body capacitance could be something else yes sir that's the most capacity because the depletion layer would also come into picture there so what whatever components would come would come when we say cgd you should mentally or be able to relate oh all these three things would contribute to the capacitance so if i tell you that my friend please reduce pgd what would you do as a designer can you control this i don't think so sir no but as a designer you can control the spacing between contact and this as a designer you can control the overall diffusion region so as a designer you can reduce the density of contacts and therefore you can control the poly two positive quality drain uh polytube contact or let us say gate to drain capacitance so what do you mean by the density of contact this is mentioned we will see once we look at the layout have we just pop this okay okay so this is the top let us be there so this is the top level view of the device poly and source engine so i can make multiple contacts over here yes sir so if i say that no i will not make two contacts i will make one contact i will reduce the capacitance now because i have reduced the area right so that was what i meant by reducing the number of contacts so as a designer you can do this so until you understand that all these three components exist you will not be able to handle the design the requirements of the design effectively okay so do not think that this is only theory there is a clear application of what we are talking about okay so i can reduce the number of contacts that is the between the three components i have only have a one component which i can play with and and i also said you can reduce the drain region the the drain area so it's a drain area i can reduce now because that is this device i can say oh i will just make it this big i will not extend rain unnecessarily so i mean drain as they made some layouts it is dependent on the active region right yeah yeah so activation you can keep it to the minimum width now not just let it run hundreds of miles so but that is basically controlled by the sizing that we have that we want to achieve this extension i'm talking about okay so i'm not i'm not aware of this parameter right yeah so we will see you will become aware pretty soon you made the layouts now in the assignment also you're making layouts yes sir so but this is not aware of this extension so i'm not controlling this because actually so i mean the bit time controlling so it is oh you're using p cells to design your layouts right you're using t cells to design your layouts you're invoking a pmos and an nmos directly then you're automatically giving away the control that you would have had to the tool none you make the layout by hand maybe the active region makes a poly you will have all the control so right right now when we have done the schematic then we do like generate from source and we get pmos involved so don't do that okay who said generate from sources only way open a virtuoso window and make the active and make the poly you have all the controls so how will you control you're giving away a lever a design lever okay okay so we can keep it to the like the minimum brc that would enable it yeah yeah so you have two levers you thought you had none okay okay so that will basically minimize that over that uh basically the coupling one the gate to drain coupling if it is this yeah see the overlap you have no control over overlap capacitance is a technology feature fabrication because that is that is what is required to ensure there is some bt some whatever that you cannot control okay but whatever you can control at least you should be aware of that right right yes okay yes so this is how the uh gate and the various capacitances you know are kind of seen over here where we say that the sea gate is eox by t-ox into width of the device into length of the device this is clear sir yes sir a small question sir so while you were mentioning about the uh pins on the drain and the gate you said that there might be more than one pin i'm like why are we yeah sorry contact my bad so uh why are we taking more than one contract sir actually i'm like uh firstly why are we taking more than one contract and why are we okay you do a pcell you make a pizza and make a device of width for two microns see how many contacts it will give you yeah sir actually i have made that but but uh in the it has given many contacts that i'm like uh that that was my daughter that's what i'm saying remove them i'm like i should remove those not all of them few of them you mean to say i have to connect them by each other or something sir remove them what does remove mean does remove mean connect no not as such sir uh okay sorry use only what is needed okay sir okay thank you sir i'll try it now why are four needed why is the one not sufficient actually that was my doubt daughter i'm like i didn't know why are we i'm like specified about the number of contacts exactly i'm like why are we even uh looking into it exactly you tell me what are contacts they are they are kind of buyers connecting the metal one with the source or the drain yes sir yes sir so if you have one wire versus you have four wires in parallel what happens okay resistance decreases i don't thank you sir okay so uh what is being shown over here is that as vgs changes as vds changes there is a diff you you can actually end up seeing different capacitance on the gate why is that so the above graph seems to be of the mass capacitor itself yes we've already done all of this okay shows the depletion region being formed and therefore the change of charges happening at the boundary of the depletion region and as soon as the inversion layer comes independent of frequency we at once have high capacitance so what is this lower graph then this these are the two components this is uh the gate coupling with body because depletion region was coming into picture and as soon as the inversion layer is formed there is no further coupling between body and gate now the additional charge comes from source and drain regions remember in the inversion layer we said that in in devices in mosfets the source and and drain will give the additional charge even at very high frequency okay so but in the lower frequency the in when the inversion is forming the charge is coming from the body itself is it then you see you see we've already shown it like this that it is coming from source and brain it is closer now it is showing that when dt has speech i think so then it's coming from source entry so this is the vt point like this so this this line is the vp point you see already this capacitance has started to rise before that what does that mean the charge the inversion is forming due to the source entry yes so since lower graph is just basically elaborating that way that confidence their components this is comp there are various components this is capacitance with bulk this is capacitance with source this is capacitance with drain it's saying that all the three components add up to form cdc gate capacitance and source and drain they have equal coupling because of equal overlap and equal density of charges there therefore this is double overall cdc is double of cgs and cgd so but this ggs is basically due to the overlap right or is it also like all the three ones is because of all three now okay sir uh in this first graph sir sir uh here uh this gate to source and gate to drain both are becoming after uh this vgs is greater than vt so they are becoming half sir uh is this because of the uniform channel formation yes because vds is kept at zero okay so after this in this sir uh this saturate nothing is told about the saturation that is the second graph that is the graph on the right side so if the if we uh increase the v this vds so this vg cs vgs and vgd both will become two by three in case in the first no the due to pinch off the drain will have no influence therefore the gate to drain capacitance goes towards zero okay and this gate to source become will become two by three will increase yes yes okay okay in the same graph yeah yeah this one no no starting the left one in the left one vds is equal to zero so yes so suppose at the end of this graph if the first graph we start increasing vds so then what will happen to vg uh vgs and that is that is what we have done over here no we started in this existing videos that is what happened so that's the continuation of it okay yes notice same points here wlc so here it would actually depend on other factors also known so yeah yeah yeah that is where the graphs are there uh yeah sir this was uh this refers to before so you told us about the three components uh i got the contact capacitance and the coupling capacitance uh that's fine but um didn't quite understand the diffusion level capacitance you talked about we will come to that welcome to that okay and uh second question is in this graph you see uh we are seeing the components uh gcs gcd and gc bulk um but yeah i mean when we had started to mosque capacitance um we were only in a sense i mean from what i understood we were only looking at the um gate to bulk because there was no source order in there yeah but here we see that the gate to bulk capacitance keeps decreasing it vanishes so it decreases for uh for a mass capacitance also now that is where we end up with the depletion region where we go to wd mass and we say this is the minimum capacitance you would have yeah yeah but donating pieces right but in this only in low frequency only low frequency then this change is happening in the inversion layer again but then sir i mean even at high frequency then it after one point it remains constant but that is low that is a low value that's that's low but um in this case it we just see it it just keeps on decreasing until it vanishes so uh okay and but this now starts to come from source and drain region therefore gate capacitance comes up okay so when you're talking about the bulk you're talking about the substituting the lot between inversion here and no no no no no no okay okay okay so now we come to the diffusion capacitance that was what you were asking hey what is happening in the diffusion capacitance so can i you are explaining this i want to ask about the right words graph the graph in the right side i i was not able to understand that yeah tell me so uh here we are we were saying the gcd is decreasing and gcs is increasing why is that so certain uh because pen shop has happened so the drain is no longer connected to the inversion layer okay the drain can no longer so when you change the gate voltage there is no longer any change in the charge towards the drain yes sir that is why that's where cjd goes to zero okay and the source side we have the charge density that is why it is increasing yes now all the charge needs to come from the source side only therefore the component or the value of cgcs increases okay okay okay but because pinch-off has happened the overall inversion layer width has reduced inversion layer availability has reduced therefore the overall capacitance is reduced okay okay so now coming to the diffusion capacitance are you able to see this tub over here i'm calling this a tub because this actually looks like a bathtub or a tub for that matter which is where we have uh doped n plus for the source ordering region let us say now if i say that this is one plate there is a pn junction on all the sides of this plate are you able to see this yes sir all the sides except this one why because depletion depletion yes because the channel is there there's an inversion layer that you're talking about okay if there was no inversion layer then it would come on this side also but in a on device they say there is an inversion layer so this this will not appear so if i want to find the capacitance of this drain or the source what happens i have to measure the capacitance on the side walls and i have to measure the capacitance of the bottom tub bottom bottom of the tub are you able to see this so but the sidewalls is like uh on the side walls you have the dioxide right uh sidewalls you have the okay so let us look at very weird so side walls you have this isolation yes but this there this is there now okay okay so yeah didn't notice okay sir yes so on the channel side the inversion is just at the surface but i have got that wd max so that would also come now because it's not wd max is there so i will get that on that side even though there is a depletion layer there is no other end of the plate because of the channel and the depletion layer so let us look at it like this over here what is what are we saying there is a depletion layer over here and then there is a rotation layer wd max over here and then the source comes so yeah yes sir so where is the other plate now so the substrate for itself will be other plate that is too far away from here and then from the inversion layer and so many places so is it like that it is becoming like negligible kind of thing because of the capacitance so capacitance of uh this part of the plate to this part of the plate it has it is it is such a big long path the dielectric thickness is so long the oxygenated depth is so big that the capacitance is insignificant in comparison to what you will see over here okay okay okay so what do we do we say that okay let us measure the the perimeter and then multiply it with the number which is cj c junction sidewall okay and let us measure the area that is the extension and the width okay so this is ls the extension and the width that will give me the area of the bottom rectangle and i multiply that with c junction and with this i get the entire the overall capacitance of the the diffusion capacitance of the drain or the source region now again if i want to reduce the drain or source capacitance what do i need to do width is fixed but i can reduce the ls are you able to see this so so this diffusion capacitance is the gate 2 ball gate tools i source drain 2 bulk and the source this is yeah in the model yeah and so one more thing say in the junction capacitance of the uh like side walls the the base this x j parameter coming into picture it should also be enough for the parameters we had it only two ls plus w yeah so you will say that c j into x j becomes c j as w ok ok because substance over here you know the depth and based on that you came up with this value of cjsw okay and so one more thing so this ls component will have that overlap component also right because that is there right or it will be subtracted yeah ls would be the entire train region whether it is below the gate or not below the gate if there is okay uh sir so you said that diffusion capacitance is a is a component of your gate to source or gate to grain capacitance but in this case it's it seems like it's a component of your uh so i mean source to bulk no oh oh so i did not say diffusion capacitance i said gate capacitance with the diffusion region okay what i meant was those extra lines of this was am i audible yes sir yeah this was gate capacitance with the diffusion region okay okay the diffusion capacitance when we use the term diffusion capacitance this is what is the diffusion capacitance that we're talking about okay yeah so the diffusion time is coming because that because of the fabrication thing right because we should diffuse the because initially the source and train regions were diffused okay that's why it is coming today they are implanted today the iron implantation is done at an earlier point of time phostine was run through and diffusion happened so that is why we called it diffusion layer so put on okay so now we come to the"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,36WFzgPvj3I,component next component of our what do you say vlsi devices which is buyers and we've already talked about buyers a little earlier so we can be relatively quick now so this is what wires are what are they made of we discussed this in much detail earlier what are the wires made of copper aluminium so in advanced technologies they're always all all fabs and advanced technologies use copper in earlier technologies let us say 180 nanometer and and and older people use aluminum because the copper process was not as defined yet however today you will also find technologies which use 180 nanometers with copper these are hybrid technologies to gain density or to have more current carrying capability and so on but yes what we are looking at is that these wires are made out of copper which is more ductile than aluminium and therefore these wires can be drawn very close to each other we also know that these wires are like these cuboids this is wire one this is wire two and when they run parallel to each other this is the kind of 3d space they will create amongst themselves so what happens what all kinds of capacitances will you see here so this is a metal running beneath let us say this is metal one and this is metal two so what all kind of capacitances will this wire one see so this uh this will see a capacitance between the other wire in the same layer and due to these kinds of forces okay yeah and i'm assuming there will be another layer above these bars yes so there could be another wire running above it so there would be lines of forces like this also and lines of forces like this are you able to see this the voice is not clear uh sir i am unable to picturize this so uh how is it different this m1 and wire on can you please there are different metal layers now we saw the dual dimension process yes yes yes so what were we doing we were making one metal layer then we made vrs and the second metal layer then we made vrs and the third metal layer so these are these metal layers the lowest plate is metal one then you have these wires in metal two then we have metal three up there okay so yeah got it okay so but metal one and different materials have been connected with diana so like but suppose i am running a clock and i am running a data signal uh data signal is running in metal one clock is running in metal two will i connect them also with the vr no no no there are two independent signals running in two different metals what's the big deal so um we're talking over here as about two things in this slide we're talking about two things width of the wires and the spacing between the wires we're also talking about thickness height of the wire and the inter metal dielectric height h okay an important thing is what is the ratio of thickness versus width of the wire in old processes wires were like this so inter metal capacitances played a big role because of lines of forces but in today's advanced technologies wires are like this so even if there is a metal layer going running from above it then there are few lines of forces between them but there are more lines of forces in the intra metal region are you able to see this so what are we what we are talking about essentially is that there are different components of capacitances c top c bot and c adjacent so in older technologies see top and c bot for the dominating capacitances but in advanced technologies of today c adjacent is a very big component of the total capacitance okay and if you want to look at how does how do these capacitances change as as you bring the wires closer or something like that you will notice that this is how it appears so we have m1 and m3 planes there planes means there is a high density of wires there and the spacing between my metal two wires is is changing like this so what do i observe that when the width of the wire is less let us look here when the width of the wire is less then an isolated wire would have this capacitance whereas a dense a dense structure of wires in metal two and method three planes would have this capacitance now if my wire width is very large then adjacent capacitance does not change much when i have isolated when i have isolated uh metal two wires then the capacitance doesn't change much but when i put metal one in metal three planes because the width of my wire is large this inter metal capacitance also starts to play a significant role so what do you mean by isolated i mean isolated as it means no metal one metal metal three planes this metal two is there okay so so we are looking at a plane not between layers here in this graph yeah um okay so what else can you reduce from here if your wires metal two wires were very close let us say 320 nanometer closed then the change in capacitance of buyers because of whether there is a metal plate up there or down there doesn't really matter much are you able to see this also so what does this hollow rhombus represent according to you so i mean s is the distance between the two wires in the same plane in the same plane right so i am saying that two wires are very close they are only 320 nanometers apart yes sir you see if there was only single wire and no other wire the wire capacitance would have been something like 60 or 70 acrocytes per micron when i brought other wires close to it reduce the spacing the capacitance has increased from that 60 to something like 230 okay right now when the wire was only there was only single wire because the spacing is infinity means there is only single wire and i put in the metal one and metal three planes the capacitors increased from 62 130 more than doubled but in a dense wire configuration when i put the metal one in the metal three planes the capacitance increased from 220 to only 230 in significant change are you able to see this okay so it means that at a very small when you're going to very smaller dimensions then the inter metal one is getting neglected intra metal capacitance dominates between the same layer it is dominating but yeah between lenses now okay yes and if you were using wide wires then yes intra metal also has some influence see what happened for very wide wires the capacitance increased from 260 to 380. i know but if your wires are thin which is usually the case then there is not much impact of whether there is a wire running up there or not that doesn't change the wire capacitance significantly are you able to see this yes sir yeah yes okay so let us look at how do these capacitances compare amongst each other typically dense fires would have a capacitance of something like 0.2 farads per micron whereas a gate would have a capacitance of one to two centified per micron we discussed this in the last session i had asked you if i have to implement the capacitance with gates or with metals i prefer to implement a capacitor with with gates why because it is much much denser you see we put the numbers over here today and uh we we see that the diffusion capacitance is also very high why because over there also there is only this pn junction the dielectric thickness is very thin okay so what is this division capacitor is coming here so i'm not no we're just talking about different capacitive components as to why how do the what is the uh typical range of different capacitances that come into picture okay so in the earlier models we are giving a number to the model yeah yeah so we're just talking about this earlier model now we're comparing the wire capacitance with this diffusion capacitance now okay okay okay it has nothing to do with our capacitance we're just saying because you're now putting the numbers i have not given you any numbers till now no first time i am giving you some numbers so so that you get a feel of what what order we are talking about okay so diffusion capacitance is actually comparable to gate capacitance but diffusion is very resistive so we do not even if we have to make capacitances we would not use diffusion as a medium to make those capacitances or even if i use a diffusion thing i will put lots of contacts over it i will put lots of wires over it metal over it so that the resistance reduces so this point i'm not going to understand to avoid using diffusion runners what is this so let us say i have a inverter that is connected to let us say another okay sorry i accidentally pressed end slide so there ya go i have to restart them this card let me restart the slideshow yeah you're able to see the slide again yes sir so let us say we have an inverter that is driving another inverter what does that mean that means there will be a poly a p mass and an n mass and the output of this pmos and n mass will go and connect to the poly of this other inverter something like this we want to do what is being said is you connected them through wires now don't go to diffusion layer and route through diffusion route only through metal now you will think why would i want to route through diffusion you may want to route through diffusion because there is the metal space is already occupied by some other metal there there is some other signal that is running in metal one so you don't have metal one available so you say okay let me go through diffusion and run it you can't do that but that is very resistive simon what is routing diffusion meaning here i mean we're connecting the metal one to the poly that is diffusion no routing means connecting with these wires this is routing yes sir yes this i understand so what is being said is don't use diffusion for routing purposes don't use diffusion runners for in place of wires so what this means what is this diffusion layer i could just make a diffusion layer like this and i would say i will see diffusion layer means active region so current will flow through a diffusion layer also we are using the diffusion you have to connect the active regions but connect them through metal okay just don't extend the active regions and connect like the both the greens okay so for very short wires you can possibly use polysilicon at times but avoid diffusion okay okay so uh one very important a quick concept so this we had already seen last time in the earlier thing we had already seen that so very quick concept i would want to give is that of sheet resistance see this edge as a designer you have no control over it do you see that this is the technology feature yes so the total resistance of a wire in that this row over s is actually constant for you yes height is in r but your overall resistance then is only dependent on l by w which we can say that l by w is equal to number of squares that i can make on this wire in the direction of flow of current are you able to see this l by w has no dimension because l is also in micron w is also in micron so it has no dimension in itself what does l by w represent the number of squares that i can make or that i have to travel in the direction of flow of the current yes so what is the unit of sheet resistance then ohms per meter per square not meter square as many squares that will be the resistance that will so i will simply multiply sheet resistance with the number of squares and i will get the value of resistance so if i have to flow current in this direction what will be the value of how many squares are there in this direction let us say this is the total length of the wires how many squares in this direction so i will get the value of 2r naught if i have to flow current in this direction now what sir half i'm not by 2 r not by 2. we have to define a unit uh square also right uh unit square is always by defined by the width when i was moving in when i was moving current in this direction the width was l and the length of which i was running was w so w by l is 1 by 2 that is where r naught by 2. when i'm moving in the other direction when i'm moving in this direction my width is w and length is f so it becomes uh and length is twice of w therefore it becomes 2 2 r naught are you able to see this so what is this square concept we are talking about because we have right so we are talking why we are talking so what is the formula of resistance rho l by a rho l by a that is what we have written over here yeah yes sir what is a the cross section through which the current is flowing yeah so i said rho by h is r naught etch [Music] no no you make metal one is you have the flexibility to change the bits of the wire you have the flexibility to change the length of the wire can you change the thickness of the wire when you're making a layout no no sir so that has fixed for the for for a given technology is it not yeah yeah yes that is what we are calling as are not okay now what do i multiply r naught with to get the value of resistance the number of squares that have to be traversed this ratio is the number of squares okay so i think we are already on time now so this this also we had we had already seen earlier so we will not look into this again we've already even had a a question in your quiz on this topic uh we will we can probably talk about polishing but that we can do later also sometime so we'll talk about these models in the next class,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36WFzgPvj3I,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36WFzgPvj3I
Transcript: component next component of our what do you say vlsi devices which is buyers and we've already talked about buyers a little earlier so we can be relatively quick now so this is what wires are what are they made of we discussed this in much detail earlier what are the wires made of copper aluminium so in advanced technologies they're always all all fabs and advanced technologies use copper in earlier technologies let us say 180 nanometer and and and older people use aluminum because the copper process was not as defined yet however today you will also find technologies which use 180 nanometers with copper these are hybrid technologies to gain density or to have more current carrying capability and so on but yes what we are looking at is that these wires are made out of copper which is more ductile than aluminium and therefore these wires can be drawn very close to each other we also know that these wires are like these cuboids this is wire one this is wire two and when they run parallel to each other this is the kind of 3d space they will create amongst themselves so what happens what all kinds of capacitances will you see here so this is a metal running beneath let us say this is metal one and this is metal two so what all kind of capacitances will this wire one see so this uh this will see a capacitance between the other wire in the same layer and due to these kinds of forces okay yeah and i'm assuming there will be another layer above these bars yes so there could be another wire running above it so there would be lines of forces like this also and lines of forces like this are you able to see this the voice is not clear uh sir i am unable to picturize this so uh how is it different this m1 and wire on can you please there are different metal layers now we saw the dual dimension process yes yes yes so what were we doing we were making one metal layer then we made vrs and the second metal layer then we made vrs and the third metal layer so these are these metal layers the lowest plate is metal one then you have these wires in metal two then we have metal three up there okay so yeah got it okay so but metal one and different materials have been connected with diana so like but suppose i am running a clock and i am running a data signal uh data signal is running in metal one clock is running in metal two will i connect them also with the vr no no no there are two independent signals running in two different metals what's the big deal so um we're talking over here as about two things in this slide we're talking about two things width of the wires and the spacing between the wires we're also talking about thickness height of the wire and the inter metal dielectric height h okay an important thing is what is the ratio of thickness versus width of the wire in old processes wires were like this so inter metal capacitances played a big role because of lines of forces but in today's advanced technologies wires are like this so even if there is a metal layer going running from above it then there are few lines of forces between them but there are more lines of forces in the intra metal region are you able to see this so what are we what we are talking about essentially is that there are different components of capacitances c top c bot and c adjacent so in older technologies see top and c bot for the dominating capacitances but in advanced technologies of today c adjacent is a very big component of the total capacitance okay and if you want to look at how does how do these capacitances change as as you bring the wires

capacitance also starts to play a significant role so what do you mean by isolated i mean isolated as it means no metal one metal metal three planes this metal two is there okay so so we are looking

earlier so we will not look into this again we've already even had a a question in your quiz on this topic uh we will we can probably talk about polishing but that we can do later also sometime so we'll talk about these models in the next class"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,Q4NRLQqQn34,but uh we are starting with the layout part which uh you may have already seen and uh which you may have already seen in the tutorials that were already shared with you and and therefore you are already working on your assignment but it is important to take care of a few things it is important to take care of a few things uh so that we can uh make good layouts in line with what we were discussing you know less capacitance and uh and all that so uh let me just give you a quick hands-on run on what things you can take care of when you're making layouts so let us say let me make just these four layers for now so in your layer map table you have green color for active region or some other color so let us say this is the active for nmos or pmos and this is the active for nmos can we say this yes and because this is p mass so we will say there is a bell around it is that okay so now let us say we have to make the functionality of a nand b so what is the circuit something like this a and let us say b are you able to see this are you with me on this part yes sir so what we are saying is that there are two nmoses and two pmosses pmosses are in parallel and muscles are in series so what would you do you would say that okay let me make the police yeah let me make the police where this poly would represent one input this poly would represent another input let us call this a let us call this b now let us make the contacts let us say this is the output i made a contact here this is ground i made a contact here this is now you will have to tell me which one should be output and which one should be vdd so it has one should be output middle one should be output why because it no because it is shared the beam i could short them like this so middle one would have uh less capacitance so output so this could be the way i could have output there you said this cannot change so actually how you're drawing this uh nand layout from this schematic that you just i'm not able to get it okay so you're able to see these signals a and b yes sir the body yes sir so when the poly intersects with the and uh active in the eval what do we get so one is a source and drain we get an n mass so we get a source and a drain there and this is another nmos and by the virtue of shared diffusion region shared active this connection is already being built there this connection is already being built am i right so similarly on the pima side there are two p masses and by the virtue of this shared diffusion region i am either making this connection or i am making this connection either of those two i am making that is what my question is which one like where would you use the shared shared diffusion like shared diffusion should be vdd or shared diffusion should be output that is what my question to you is output shared definition should be output why because we get our output from the middle of the pemos and the lms so i think it could be both because like because then also the source and drainage source is also shared then daniel yeah they are in parallel electrically yeah that's also what i'm thinking it doesn't make a difference to me it doesn't make a difference to you you've already talked about capacitances huh see where did i start this uh this discussion from from a question on capacitances so this is a hint so there can be two things one thing is in the current configuration you are taking the metal over the poly two times okay and and and if you if you do the vdd on both sides then you have to take the take it to above the for the railing that would be going above for the vdd but it would not be over the poly it would be at a minimum drc from the poly maybe you can increase that if you don't want to lose the area so you cannot you cannot but increase that and decrease the capacitance also okay anything else there visit when in the middle one in the that contact to poly there is contact to public capacitance in both sides so there will be initially some load capacitance also so if we could make the capacity capacitance less somehow then switching could be done more faster means we have to discharge and charge less okay so what should we do so i mean as as i can see uh diffusion capacitances won't change how do we connect because we have this because that is dependent up according to me upon the active area only so if the area center diffusion capacitance it doesn't make a difference like where do i know what you're saying so what you're telling me is that this area is same as some of these areas no sir so i am saying as i'm saying that uh the diffusion capacitance depends upon what is the area of my source and drain yeah so if you if i would connect y this y node on on the outer things this is the area that i am looking at anna whereas if i keep my output over here this is the area i will look at no sir but this area will come because it is source of source area is also coming right because we cannot think of your drain area output it's my area if my wire is here why would the capacitance of this node appear on my output so but the diffusion capacitance was the sum of the source right you said total different capacitance of sum of source and drain capacitance we only looked at one capacitance we said whether it is source or drain this is the capac this is how you should calculate the capacitance it was sum of two components what were the two components okay okay right right okay it was sum of two components but what were those two components again this is a hint that was one was the width and the ls length so so such that ls part one of the ls part gets eliminated if we do the middle one tapping so i have only one case so basically though yeah so only one ls gets eliminated or both the ls both the bits get eliminated so see even if you tell me that this area is same as this area what happens there is a junction sidewall junction capacitance also which is appearing only for this here but in the in this region it will it is appearing for all three sites yes sir sir i'm sorry sir but i'm really unable to i'm like uh uh i'm like correlate this both structure sir uh i'm like could you please explain that ceremony so what are you not able to correlate sir uh there are uh four uh uh two pmos and two queen most according to the structure i do understand that but yeah that uh i'm like i literally can't see those fours are over here you can't see four okay yes sir you see this is one transistor let us call this p1 so how did that become a transistor so that was made out actually this is poly running over our active region yes yes sir that becomes a transistor okay okay we saw the top level view of the transistor in the last class also this is how it looked me yes sir so up my last class revised me curry uh actually uh i didn't revise it sir to be honest so we did that in the last class so that is the poly poly over active is a transistor that is p1 so it has its input at a so this is p1 the pmos with input b is let us say call it p2 so this is p2 yes okay the nmas with input a let us call it n1 so this is n1 and mass with input b we call it n2 yes sir okay yes sir uh now i understand about are you able to see yes sir so sir uh uh a small dot sir so uh i'm like uh even this might have been discussed but yeah sir sir where are these drain source and gate regions are exactly of this pmos you tell me what do you see here where are the source and drain regions what is source and drain source so towards the left and right side i'm like of this poly towards the left and right of this poly there is a source and drain region so then what are these ones are exactly and then you're not worked on the assignment yet you're not paying too late i'd say i did that sir and but but when i generated sir they were directly coming so i'm like i didn't see any so again you should so friends it's important because i will be building upon what we discussed in the last class anna whatever i have discussed earlier uh i will be building up upon that so i myself try to upload the lectures within you know as early as possible within one hour two hour of the class have you noticed that yes sir why do i do that to give us time to because i want you to review what we have discussed if there are any questions you should ask the tas in the office hours if there is anything else you should discuss with us in the next class otherwise i will as well upload all the lectures together and towards the you know closer to the midsim or the nsm exam should i do that no sir the intent is that when you look at the uh you know when you go through the class i know you might be in one particular state of mind you might get stuck with some idea some previous topic discussion there is some question pending and you are stuck there and we moved ahead in the class and okay later you asked the question that questions get solved but there is some little concept which you have missed so i share the lectures very as early as possible so that you are able to review the concept and refresh and fill in for anything that you might have missed yes sir it's important now yes sir so please uh review whatever has been you if you're writing notes review from your notes otherwise i'm uploading the lectures review from the lectures so these yellow ones are contacts so if you've made the layouts you would have already seen these contacts me yes sir so why the question then uh i'm like okay uh so there are two pins right so i'm like there are drain and source on the left and right of that but i'm like we have made contact only for one so that we are connecting that i'm like we aren't mentioning the other one uh because it's not needed so yeah yeah see that is where i am responding to gandhi's query how do we reduce the number of contacts how do we reduce the source and drain area see if you would use the p cells which i dissuaded you from using in the last class also if you use the p cells what will happen let us look at it if you use the pieces then you will get one transistor we will get four circuits you will get another transistor you will make another transistor here you will make another transistor here and you will probably connect the poly like this you will probably connect the poly like this again and then you will put contacts everywhere yes sir and make the connection accordingly hello so what happens in all this in all this okay you may say that okay this is ground this is vdd uh this is the shared node i will connect them like this i will connect them like this huh yes sir and this is again vdd and i say this is my output yes sir so what is happening now what is what how many capacitances do we see if we just count poly to contact capacitances there are one two three four five six seven eight eight capacitances from poly to contact yes sir additionally there are eight source entrained capacitances also yes sir so even if we say that area of shared active region even if we say that area of the shared active region is same as the area of these independent actors what happens [Music] just give me a minute [Music] yeah so even if we say that even if we say that this area of shared active is equal to the area of the two independent actors what extra capacitance do i have here i have this side wall capacitance coming in extra plus at least one of these drain capacitances is extra so but that will be basically but when i'm extending the shared region then basically i don't think that will become me an extra thing because the same area would come this under the shared region also right so i said if we go with the assumption go with you know be careful about what i said okay so okay if we look at it over here what would be the length of extension of this region it would be poly2 contact space plus contact width plus uh od extension so you're calling it od diffusion layer you're calling it od in your lsw what do you call it yeah so these three things will make one source or drain region am i right let us put some numbers let us say poly2 contact is 50 nanometer uh contact with this let us say 60 nanometers and let us say od extension beyond poly is 30 nanometer so this would come out to be 140 nanometers yes sir okay now now let us come here so in this region we we are putting one contact so what is the spacing between these two polys poly2 contact plus contact width plus poly2 contact are you able to see this yes let's put the numbers now 50 plus 60 plus 50. 160 nanometer so effectively kidnapping with 140 over here 140 over here the width effective weight over there was 280 280 right over here we are talking about 160 right so diffusion capacitance would reduce drastically diffusion capacitance reduce reduces not just because of area getting reduced it so it also reduces because the sidewall junction capacitance also does not come right right thanks yes okay additionally how many positive contact capacitances do you see now 1 2 4 4 5 six six six wahabi kidney thing how many were there eight eight so you see you are able to reduce that capacitance also so even that the field the field the capacity of the field also reduces because we have the shared trains right there was some field also right there between the uh contact to sorry gate and uh drain gate and source there were three components right so that feel also i think it's reduces because of this yeah because that you can say because the drain area reduces that can reduce yes that will also reduce the poly two the poly two drain capacitance would also reduce because the drain region is smaller in total length

Transcript: but uh we are starting with the layout part which uh you may have already seen and uh which you may have already seen in the tutorials that were already shared with you and and therefore you are already working on your assignment but it is important to take care of a few things it is important to take care of a few things uh so that we can uh make good layouts in line with what we were discussing you know less capacitance and uh and all that so uh let me just give you a quick hands-on run on what things you can take care of when you're making layouts so let us say let me make just these four layers for now so in your layer map table you have green color for active region or some other color so let us say this is the active for nmos or pmos and this is the active for nmos can we say this yes and because this is p mass so we will say there is a bell around it is that okay so now let us say we have to make the functionality of a nand b so what is the circuit something like this a and let us say b are you able to see this are you with me on this part yes sir so what we are saying is that there are two nmoses and two pmosses pmosses are in parallel and muscles are in series so what would you do you would say that okay let me make the police yeah let me make the police where this poly would represent one input this poly would represent another input let us call this a let us call this b now let us make the contacts let us say this is the output i made a contact here this is ground i made a contact here this is now you will have to tell me which one should be output and which one should be vdd so it has one should be output middle one should be output why because it no because it is shared the beam i could short them like this so middle one would have uh less capacitance so output so this could be the way i could have output there you said this cannot change so actually how you're drawing this uh nand layout from this schematic that you just i'm not able to get it okay so you're able to see these signals a and b yes sir the body yes sir so when the poly intersects with the and uh active in the eval what do we get so one is a source and drain we get an n mass so we get a source and a drain there and this is another nmos and by the virtue of shared diffusion region shared active this connection is already being built there this connection is already being built am i right so similarly on the pima side there are two p masses and by the virtue of this shared diffusion region i am either making this connection or i am making this connection either of those two i am making that is what my question is which one like where would you use the shared shared diffusion like shared diffusion should be vdd or shared diffusion should be output that is what my question to you is output shared definition should be output why because we get our output from the middle of the pemos and the lms so i think it could be both because like because then also the source and drainage source is also shared then daniel yeah they are in parallel electrically yeah that's also what i'm thinking it doesn't make a difference to me it doesn't make a difference to you you've already talked about capacitances huh see where did i start this uh this discussion from from a question on capacitances so this is a hint so there can be two things one thing is in the current configuration you are taking the metal over the poly two times okay and and and if you if you do the vdd on both sides then you have to take the take it to above the for the railing that would be going above for the vdd but it would not be over the poly it would be at a minimum drc from the poly maybe you can increase that if you don't want to lose the area so you cannot you cannot but increase that and decrease the capacitance also okay anything else there visit when in the middle one in the that contact to poly there is contact to public capacitance in both sides so there will be initially some load capacitance also so if we could make the capacity capacitance less somehow then switching could be done more faster means we have to discharge and charge less okay so what should we do so i mean as as i can see uh diffusion capacitances won't change how do we connect because we have this because that is dependent up according to me upon the active area only so if the area center diffusion capacitance it doesn't make a difference like where do i know what you're saying so what you're telling me is that this area is same as some of these areas no sir so i am saying as i'm saying that uh the diffusion capacitance depends upon what is the area of my source and drain yeah so if you if i would connect y this y node on on the outer things this is the area that i am looking at anna whereas if i keep my output over here this is the area i will look at no sir but this area will come because it is source of source area is also coming right because we cannot think of your drain area output it's my area if my wire is here why would the capacitance of this node appear on my output so but the diffusion capacitance was the sum of the source right you said total different capacitance of sum of source and drain capacitance we only looked at one capacitance we said whether it is source or drain this is the capac this is how you should calculate the capacitance it was sum of two components what were the two components okay okay right right okay it was sum of two components but what were those two components again this is a hint that was one was the width and the ls length so so such that ls part one of the ls part gets eliminated if we do the middle one tapping so i have only one case so basically though yeah so only one ls gets eliminated or both the ls both the bits get eliminated so see even if you tell me that this area is same as this area what happens there is a junction sidewall junction capacitance also which is appearing only for this here but in the in this region it will it is appearing for all three sites yes sir sir i'm sorry sir but i'm really unable to i'm like uh uh i'm like correlate this both structure sir uh i'm like could you please explain that ceremony so what are you not able to correlate sir uh there are uh four uh uh two pmos and two queen most according to the structure i do understand that but yeah that uh i'm like i literally can't see those fours are over here you can't see four okay yes sir you see this is one transistor let us call this p1 so how did that become a transistor so that was made out actually this is poly running over our active region yes yes sir that becomes a transistor okay okay we saw the top level view of the transistor in the last class also this is how it looked me yes sir so up my last class revised me curry uh actually uh i didn't revise it sir to be honest so we did that in the last class so that is the poly poly over active is a transistor that is p1 so it has its input at a so this is p1 the pmos with input b is let us say call it p2 so this is p2 yes okay the nmas with input a let us call it n1 so this is n1 and mass with input b we call it n2 yes sir okay yes sir uh now i understand about are you able to see yes sir so sir uh uh a small dot sir so uh i'm like uh even this might have been discussed but yeah sir sir where are these drain source and gate regions are exactly of this pmos you tell me what do you see here where are the source and drain regions what is source and drain source so towards the left and right side i'm like of this poly towards the left and right of this poly there is a source and drain region so then what are these ones are exactly and then you're not worked on the assignment yet you're not paying too late i'd say i did that sir and but but when i generated sir they were directly coming so i'm like i didn't see any so again you should so friends it's important because i will be building upon what we discussed in the last class anna whatever i have discussed earlier uh i will be building up upon that so i myself try to upload the lectures within you know as early as possible within one hour two hour of the class have you noticed that yes sir why do i do that to give us time to because i want you to review what we have discussed if there are any questions you should ask the tas in the office hours if there is anything else you should discuss with us in the next class otherwise i will as well upload all the lectures together and towards the you know closer to the midsim or the nsm exam should i do that no sir the intent is that when you look at the uh you know when you go through the class i know you might be in one particular state of mind you might get stuck with some idea some previous topic discussion there is some question pending and you are stuck there and we moved ahead in the class and okay later you asked the question that questions get solved but there is some little concept which you have missed so i share the lectures very as early as possible so that you are able to review the concept and refresh and fill in for anything that you might have missed yes sir it's important now yes sir so please uh review whatever has been you if you're writing notes review from your notes otherwise i'm uploading the lectures review from the lectures so these yellow ones are contacts so if you've made the layouts you would have already seen these contacts me yes sir so why the question then uh i'm like okay uh so there are two pins right so i'm like there are drain and source on the left and right of that but i'm like we have made contact only for one so that we are connecting that i'm like we aren't mentioning the other one uh because it's not needed so yeah yeah see that is where i am responding to gandhi's query how do we reduce the number of contacts how do we reduce the source and drain area see if you would use the p cells which i dissuaded you from using in the last class also if you use the p cells what will happen let us look at it if you use the pieces then you will get one transistor we will get four circuits you will get another transistor you will make another transistor here you will make another transistor here and you will probably connect the poly like this you will probably connect the poly like this again and then you will put contacts everywhere yes sir and make the connection accordingly hello so what happens in all this in all this okay you may say that okay this is ground this is vdd uh this is the shared node i will connect them like this i will connect them like this huh yes sir and this is again vdd and i say this is my output yes sir so what is happening now what is what how many capacitances do we see if we just count poly to contact capacitances there are one two three four five six seven eight eight capacitances from poly to contact yes sir additionally there are eight source entrained capacitances also yes sir so even if we say that area of shared active region even if we say that area of the shared active region is same as the area of these independent actors what happens [Music] just give me a minute [Music] yeah so even if we say that even if we say that this area of shared active is equal to the area of the two independent actors what extra capacitance do i have here i have this side wall capacitance coming in extra plus at least one of these drain capacitances is extra so but that will be basically but when i'm extending the shared region then basically i don't think that will become me an extra thing because the same area would come this under the shared region also right so i said if we go with the assumption go with you know be careful about what i said okay so okay if we look at it over here what would be the length of extension of this region it would be poly2 contact space plus contact width plus uh od extension so you're calling it od diffusion layer you're calling it od in your lsw what do you call it yeah so these three things will make one source or drain region am i right let us put some numbers let us say poly2 contact is 50 nanometer uh contact with this let us say 60 nanometers and let us say od extension beyond poly is 30 nanometer so this would come out to be 140 nanometers yes sir okay now now let us come here so in this region we we are putting one contact so what is the spacing between these two polys poly2 contact plus contact width plus poly2 contact are you able to see this yes let's put the numbers now 50 plus 60 plus 50. 160 nanometer so effectively kidnapping with 140 over here 140 over here the width effective weight over there was 280 280 right over here we are talking about 160 right so diffusion capacitance would reduce drastically diffusion capacitance reduce reduces not just because of area getting reduced it so it also reduces because the sidewall junction capacitance also does not come right right thanks yes okay additionally how many positive contact capacitances do you see now 1 2 4 4 5 six six six wahabi kidney thing how many were there eight eight so you see you are able to reduce that capacitance also so even that the field the field the capacity of the field also reduces because we have the shared trains right there was some field also right there between the uh contact to sorry gate and uh drain gate and source there were three components right so that feel also i think it's reduces because of this yeah because that you can say because the drain area reduces that can reduce yes that will also reduce the poly two the poly two drain capacitance would also reduce because the drain region is smaller in total length yeah"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,D59Otum6EqA,mould also so uh when we are doing the schematic sir so we were we were much precise on the bits to be precise so when we generated it uh we got the uh yeah we did generate but i will try it again using this so when we generated it we got the uh ps and pmos and nmos of different lengths i'm like okay whenever i give the width as seven or eight it and the width of nmos has a four or five you are using widths of seven microns in your assignment yes sir oh my god uh so we really need that white transistors sir actually we didn't know how to cut the pmos and nmos into fingers so uh literally i placed one below the other vertically by generating it and uh that that's how it happens so so there is 20 femto load on the inverter yes sir and 25 20 and 7 and they were asking in 20 picoseconds sir i'm like uh even that was not possible by using ns i'm not okay that was possible but a bit hard to achieve in nsvt lp but it was happening in nlp tlp uh so uh yes so what was your question uh one second sir actually i forgot my question uh okay yeah i i yeah i got i i got it so uh whenever we were using the width sir we i'm like for suppose seven and four uh we we got different uh lengths of the pmos and n monster sir but uh now here if we do it directly then uh how would we mention i'm not measure the width of the pmos and nmrs because we are just running the poly over the active regions so over there width was predefined in the schematic and then we went to the layout directly and we generated so over here when you're making these rectangles the active rectangles you make this as width c and you make this as bit pen okay so we are supposed to measure that with a scale and that's it right sir yeah how else would you ensure the accuracy okay sir part would be the this that we had to basically ensure the length part would be when we are making when without the pieces the length part will have to be the channel length plus these are poly to contact and then that length length the length which you use 60 nanometer or 65 nanometer or 80 nanometer this is l the width of the poly yeah and then i have to for the minimum drc i will take that po po to co and that so that will issue the minimum area yes minimum area would also have this minimum active to od to n well spacing and so many see all these will lead to rules me yes sir yeah yeah so actually this it's the first load so we're not aware of all these rules so that's why maybe so that is why i'm covering this in the class don't worry don't worry you're not i know you've not done this earlier okay so sir i had one doubt so suppose for example like earlier we were seeing the like nand structure right so for example you made a shared like shared basically some area was shared right and to me uh for example what i'm looking at is that what area capacitance is basically getting transferred to the output so i'm only focusing on that right so for example if i say i've only considered an nmos a for example and uh for example right we have a poly right generally we draw one poly and then we have a one source string suppose we kind of like uh to reduce that area maybe to like if we have a for example uh like me uh sort of divide the poly sort of and like make a like a like some kind of structure delica so that we have a like brain in the common and then we are connecting source with metal one and then we are connecting to so for example to the what exactly the fact that i'm looking at here like so the i'm only looking at the diffusion capacitance area see only the thing i'm looking at diffusion should reduce and then basically whatever appears at the load that would be my driving factor only yeah so yeah let me take you to that this is actually raghav what you're asking is if i try to answer vaishnav's question that okay i have seven microns of cmos and five microns of pen mask and i have to draw them how do i draw them so avid possibly what you guys are doing is you are saying that okay i will make one big pmos over here i will make one big n moss over here and i will make a poly between them and this is what how my thing would look like yeah whatever be the width you are this is five microns and i'm done with my inverter but that is not how that is not how library cell layouts are made come to think of it i tell you you have to make a wall we are going back to the construction analogy i want you to make a brick wall and then i say that okay some bricks are uh this tall other some other brick is this tall another brick is this tall and then there is a brick which is this wide but that tall and so on so will you be able to make a good wall no sir no yeah what is done is we say that okay nothing doing nothing of this or doing all the cells that you have to make whether it is an inverter whether it is a nand gate whether it is a nor gate or an aoi or whatever cells you are making we will use a standard fixed height now what you will what you can change is that if there is a small cell you will use only this much width but if it's a big cell you will use much larger width using the same area but the height is fixed now what happens now you can actually place these tiles one over another and you can make a big wall am i right are you able to see this yes sir so but i have one thing to ask so here as when i'm when i'm drawing the layout the height is not even in my control so height is fixed now as of now i am telling you you will have to fix the height otherwise how will you go about making this wall later but right now with the inverter we are having okay because we are having two cells only so that's why it is because you did not even think you have to hide constraints if i tell you you have to constrain the height what will you do so but the tight parameter i couldn't see that it was anywhere mentioned in the like it is not mentioned but i am telling you now so somewhere we can change the height you are seeing that so let me say let me ask you if i have to draw the seven micron or the p mass in a height of one micron what will you do sir actually i'm not able to get that height and said that what exactly is meaning by this height than one micron are you meaning that the thickness of the gate oxide no no no i am saying this vertical extent should be less than one micron but my effective female should be seven microns wide i mean so this extension is itself the width right so i mean sorry i can't break place one by one each other in vertical one micro one micro one micro seven times and connect them so what i can do is i will say that so now let me go to so this is this is how the layout view would look okay let's say that uh we will see it's not a layout it takes a lot of time i have to make so many rectangles so there's a different representation of layouts which is called as stick diagrams so you will find lots of details on stick diagrams on your west a also okay so what do we do we say that okay there is one p mass uh so each so this this this horizontal line represents what we call as uh active region of let us say maximum one one micron width can we say this can we say this that this horizontal line represents active region active this this kind of a rectangle which is one micron wide can i make this assumption so you're taking the bit to be one micron right yeah but i'm showing it representing it only as one line i'm not making it into a rectangle over here i made this rectangle to represent the active region right where i'm saying i'm just using a line i'm just using a stick can i do that okay so you're not representing the length basically of channel i'm i'm just representing the width the width of the active region i'm not even talking about polyethylene i am not using rectangles i am just using sticks that is why it is called a stick diagram similarly i use sticks for the poly also so let me say that this represents poly this rectangle the rectangle that we have made over here that is represented by one stick over here vertical stick red one in color can i say this yes let me say contacts i am representing by such process can i say this is it yes yes now if i have to make a pmos which is 7 microns wide what do i do i say that okay i have just one micron width available to me to make a seven micron device i will put seven p mosses in parallel and what does parallel mean parallel means that i will have to short we will short all the drains together and not all the planes so i will now short let us say ah sorry and this and i will short the other like this black one is also metal i'll just use vdd for black and or what else do i need to shot i need to also short the police w gate connector are you able to see this so it's a bit confusing sir i mean uh like one is black and what what what why why can't be a single one i'm not able to get no no i just use the black one because it was available ready there i can make it do don't worry let me make it blue i mean it's a vine why not connecting all the eight contacts with a single like metal kind of running like you're missing two sets right okay you tell me you should have the answer for this we are connecting the drains together and source together right sir in this yeah if i connect all eight of them together then all the sources will be shorted yes yeah okay okay so what do i need to do to make two devices in parallel i need to short their gates and the source and the drains there are three nodes that i need to short am i right yes sir that is what i am doing one two and three so now whatever device size whether you want to make seven microns or ten microns or whatever can you make it within the height of let us say a total height of one point yeah five microns or something let us say whatever can you make it yes so this process is called as splitting into fingers sir yes so using this parallel dividing it into fingers won't this increase the area uh yes but what were you constrained about you have to build a wall yes yes sir actually i was i tried a similar thing i was able to make the specification in smaller bits but then i thought of area then i skipped this idea you have to do it like this you have to fix the height so how do you fix the height which we hide boldly or how do i arrive at a height how much high do i need for these cells version you have a question your hand is raised sorry sir uh okay so how do we raise how do we fix the height so this height i'm not able to visualize it so for example this width itself the height we are still talking about the width itself no see how it is okay let us look at it like this let me visualize it because i'm not able to get what exactly i mean my height height by number of uh pmos or nmos we want so that we can fix the height of uh each pmos smaller so let us go back to this layout i want to find the height of this this cell how would i calculate it i will say there is active to nvel od to envelope spacing plus let us say this is wp wp plus od to any then plus od to the n by 2 od yeah right plus width of n mass yeah and then and then extension of poly and then if i would make up if i have to consider that i have to make walls then this cell would would come above another cell are you are you able to see this so this this hole is a one cell this whole nand gate yeah this would be one cell there would be another cell that would come beneath it so i have to ensure this poly to poly spacing is also taken care of okay okay so i will do po2po by two why why buy two the minimum spacing is we have to ensure right yeah because if i leave half drc here half drc in the other cell overall full drc will be met yeah so the other pos of the another cell you're talking about now in excel okay okay so what what has happened now now this is what is my height so wound the p tap and that uh via that that also come into picture here because in layout very smart so it's taking me further ahead in the session great so now look at it like this why do we need peter and end taps yeah yeah that that was not clear even yesterday i asked in the office also so i mean because because it was very we have uh actually in the virtual layout like the gui we are taking we are calling it as a vr but i don't i was able to relate it why we're calling it vr i mean it doesn't appears to me like we are creating some vr or that no no it's not about vr my question is why do we need n-tap and p-tap so i see motherhood if you have raised your hands mother you have a question yes sir i have questions yeah so can you show [Music] this is one entire drain region for different this is one active region which gets split into source and drain depending on where the poly is okay so so uh so some wooden source and drain i mean the source let us let us call the first source and drain for transistor one and the next source entrance because i put s over here this is the source this is the drain then for for this part this one be the this is the because drain is shared so this is the drain then that becomes the source now source is shared so for the other thing the other part becomes a drain so that is why we connected alternate uh contacts alternate active regions we can we connected through metals to get source and drain nodes so this node is drain node and this node is source node and this node is great date okay and so how are two sources uh adjacent source entries being isolated from each other you tell me let us draw the let us draw the horizontal or the cross section view so what will we find there we will it's called wait wait let us s give me a minute so let us draw the cross section let us say this is the silicon surface let us say uh one poly second poly third poly fourth poly and so on so what is happening in this source and drain region you are getting this diffusion first diffusion second diffusion third diffusion fourth diffusion fifth diffusion then what did you do you made metals and you connected this one with this and this and through another set of metals you connected this let me just and this and you would go here um so is there a way that source and drain would get shorted amongst each other henna so look just look at the cross section it will not happen source antenna separated from each other through the depletion region okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D59Otum6EqA,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D59Otum6EqA

so what i can do is i will say that so now let me go to so this is this is how the layout view would look okay let's say that uh we will see it's not a layout it takes a lot of time i have to make so many rectangles so there's a different representation of layouts which is called as stick diagrams so you will find lots of details on stick diagrams on your west a also okay so what do we do we say that okay there is one p mass uh so each so this this this horizontal line represents what we call as uh active region of let us say maximum one one micron width can we say this can we say this that this horizontal line represents active region active this this kind of a rectangle which is one micron wide can i make this assumption so you're taking the bit to be one micron right yeah but i'm showing it representing it only as one line i'm not making it into a rectangle over here i made this rectangle to represent the active region right where i'm saying i'm just using a line i'm just using a stick can i do that okay so you're not representing the length basically of channel i'm i'm just representing the width the width of the active region i'm not even talking about polyethylene i am not using rectangles i am just using sticks that is why it is called a stick diagram similarly i use sticks for the poly also so let me say that this represents poly this rectangle the rectangle that we have made over here that is represented by one stick over here vertical stick red one in color can i say this yes let me say contacts i am representing by such process can i say this is it yes yes now if i have to make a pmos which is 7 microns wide what do i do i say that okay i have just one micron width available to me to make a seven micron device i will put seven p mosses in parallel and what does parallel mean parallel means that i will have to short we will short all the drains together and not all the planes so i will now short let us say ah sorry and this and i will short the other like this black one is also metal i'll just use vdd for black and or what else do i need to shot i need to also short the police w gate connector are you able to see this so it's a bit confusing sir i mean uh like one is black and what what what why why can't be a single one i'm not able to get no no i just use the black one because it was available ready there i can make it do don't worry let me make it blue i mean it's a vine why not connecting all the eight contacts with a single like metal kind of running like you're missing two sets right okay you tell me you should have the answer for this we are connecting the drains together and source together right sir in this yeah if i connect all eight of them together then all the sources will be shorted yes yeah okay okay so what do i need to do to make two devices in parallel i need to short their gates and the source and the drains there are three nodes that i need to short am i right yes sir that is what i am doing one two and three so now whatever device size whether you want to make seven microns or ten microns or whatever can you make it within the height of let us say a total height of one point yeah five microns or something let us say whatever can you make it yes so this process is called as splitting into fingers sir yes so using this parallel dividing it into fingers won't this increase the area uh yes but what were you constrained about you have to build a wall yes yes sir actually i was i tried a similar thing i was able to make the specification in smaller bits but then i thought of area then i skipped this idea you have to do it like this you have to fix the height so how do you fix the height which we hide boldly or how do i arrive at a height how much high do i need for these cells version you have a question your hand is raised sorry sir uh okay so how do we raise how do we fix the height so this height i'm not able to visualize it so for example this width itself the height we are still talking about the width itself no see how it is okay let us look at it like this let me visualize it because i'm not able to get what exactly i mean my height height by number of uh pmos or nmos we want so that we can fix the height of uh each pmos smaller so let us go back to this layout i want to find the height of this this cell how would i calculate it i will say there is active to nvel od to envelope spacing plus let us say this is wp wp plus od to any then plus od to the n by 2 od yeah right plus width of n mass yeah and then and then extension of poly and then if i would make up if i have to consider that i have to make walls then this cell would would come above another cell are you are you able to see this so this this hole is a one cell this whole nand gate yeah this would be one cell there would be another cell that would come beneath it so i have to ensure this poly to poly spacing is also taken care of okay okay so i will do po2po by two why why buy two the minimum spacing is we have to ensure right yeah because if i leave half drc here half drc in the other cell overall full drc will be met yeah so the other pos of the another cell you're talking about now in excel okay okay so what what has happened now now this is what is my height so wound the p tap and that uh via that that also come into picture here because in layout very smart so it's taking me further ahead in the session great so now look at it like this why do we need peter and end taps yeah yeah that that was not clear even yesterday i asked in the office also so i mean because because it was very we have uh actually in the virtual layout like the gui we are taking we are calling it as a vr but i don't i was able to relate it why we're calling it vr i mean it doesn't appears to me like we are creating some vr or that no no it's not about vr my question is why do we need n-tap and p-tap so i see motherhood if you have raised your hands mother you have a question yes sir i have questions yeah so can you show [Music] this is one entire drain region for different this is one active region which gets split into source and drain depending on where the poly is okay so so uh so some wooden source and drain i mean the source let us let us call the first source and drain for transistor one and the next source entrance because i put s over here this is the source this is the drain then for for this part this one be the this is the because drain is shared so this is the drain then that becomes the source now source is shared so for the other thing the other part becomes a drain so that is why we connected alternate uh contacts alternate active regions we can we connected through metals to get source and drain nodes so this node is drain node and this node is source node and this node is great date okay and so how are two sources uh adjacent source entries being isolated from each other you tell me let us draw the let us draw the horizontal or the cross section view so what will we find there we will it's called wait wait let us s give me a minute so let us draw the cross section let us say this is the silicon surface let us say uh one poly second poly third poly fourth poly and so on so what is happening in this source and drain region you are getting this diffusion first diffusion second diffusion third diffusion fourth diffusion fifth diffusion then what did you do you made metals and you connected this one with this and this and through another set of metals you connected this let me just and this and you would go here um so is there a way that source and drain would get shorted amongst each other henna so look just look at the cross section it will not happen source antenna separated from each other through the depletion region okay"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,3Dg814jyk_o,how did we make that decision that from where i'm going to tap the vdd and from where i'm going to tap down i have not concluded that yet have we concluded that question yet you've not even answered my question yet so we'll come to that we will come to that in fact you should be able to tell me by after the as we progress what should be i said that and uh that p type is because we want the bodies of all the nmos to connect to ground and the and the n12 m1 bi is for nvel should be connected to vdd so we are tapping that yeah you've heard about latch up any one of you yes we talked about latch up in one of the earlier classes also what is latch up there is a internal bjt that gets on yeah because there is this pn region which is there i know so latch up can happen and what did we say sir so can you elaborate on this latch up i'm not able to get it uh so latch up though uh already one of the earlier courses even i think uh any course on silicon technology would have covered on laptop now so i will look into it yeah so what happens is there is this you're talking about an inverter let us say an inverter only one of them is in the pivot and the other is in the n so what is this region suppose let us say this is n well this is n mos so what is this region this is p this is n this is n this is n this is p this is p are you able to see this yes sir so what happens is if you will so any west day has it rabi has it all those books have it so what happens is that uh this npn and pnp kind of uh bjt configurations get built so we can we kind of end up making a circuit where if there is some value of resistance in one place then this circuit would go into a huge current flow situation everything will completely burn out it must say it can be an egg bnpf so the only way to avoid that is that you have to reduce these resistances what happens when i reduce the resistance suppose i have to sink current i through this if i reduce the resistance what happens the voltage that appears and the base and emitter of across the vbe for this particular bjt will reduce similarly if i reduce this resistance the vbe for this one would reduce so i would be able to ensure that none of the transistors is on but if this resistance goes high what happens for the same current this vbe will go high and the transistors will turn on and once these parasitic bjp is turned on there is huge flow of current which is called as latch up it's kind of making a latch it is a positive feedback loop that comes into picture that is why the term latch so the substrate kind of gets latched up and it completely burns out so so this current is flowing within the substrate right because the clutch-up is happening within that substrate yeah so you tell me when we said that uh we have a transistor switching happening so some charges would flow now yes sir some charges would flow into the body and form the body yeah different bodies might be connected all the different end builds of that people yeah so that flow of charge is happening through the body so there is some current that is flowing even if that current is small some current is flowing is it not yes sir but then what is this all about the resistance so but this resistance is basically what this character is characterizes which part is characterizing this resistance the resistance of the body the substrate region okay so but that would be controlled by the doping we have what kind of dopamine doping yes and also suppose i say that okay over here i put a n plus and i put vdd over here so this resistance was from vdd to this n now vdd is available right here so the resistance is less suppose this entire latch up is based on our assumption that there is a transistor being formed but yeah that this doesn't feel like a very good transistor because in because in a transistor the base region is very very thin yes but here yeah always we thought that this would not cause a problem but it causes problems even with very low gain even if the gain is 1.1 it is again is it not it will not act very fast it will take one second to respond but within one second there will be latch up and what happens your device will burn out are you able to see this so so with this p tap and this m1 and w we are creating this n plus regions or that regions and that basically helps us in preventing the latch up there these are called substrate connections and they have to be given at a at a distance or at a maximum spacing as specified by the technology people so spacing which spacing you're talking about here the spacing between uh two p taps or two end tabs so technology people tell that every 30 microns you have to have place a p tap otherwise there can be latch up okay okay right okay david you said uh sorry in earlier lectures you told that uh substrate coupling extraction uh will be not doing in this course so the thing is that uh uh we won't be taking care of issues like latch up but when i was making the way we're not taking care of substrate coupling extraction but did i also say we will not take care of flatup oh no sir so that is a reduction you are making i did not say that lancep is something every designer has to take care of come whatever may so because i observed that when i was putting in tap for pmos and not enclosing with the envelope it was showing something lup yeah i thought that would do something strange for you yes so it will not even do lvs screen if you do not put speed apps and taps it will give you stamping error so the the the system will not even let you proceed if you do not put these uh taps there okay okay whenever we create the pin we would get a bigger name of our g ground we'll get that as bigger one uh what i'm saying what what when i using the word tap i am meaning substrate connections okay okay don't confuse it with contacts contacts are something else so for the pmos the envel mmo was the tap right for the p mass the n bill m1 yeah was the tab right no tap is made separately for example in an anvil when the pmos is made in an anvil you will make an n plus region so i'm talking with the layout that we are making for the to connect the nmos we are using the p tab right but for that vdd for the pmos we are using a m1 envelope via and that is basically maybe doing the kind of substrate connection so that's my asking so that would be a considered as a p tab sorry the tab for the pmos no don't uh so avi if you're using t cells the tab will come automatically okay you will have you have a a p cell for tap okay otherwise if you're making layouts like this so that your layouts are denser they are closer to what you wanted in the schematic and so on then you will have to make a tab separately see are we in this particular layout what did i not show i did not show the uh i did not so tap is not vr tap is something else that is what let us let me complete so what i what what i am not showing is another layer which is over here for the n mass it is called as uh and it is called as n plus and for the p mass we have another layer which is called as p plus have you seen that layer in your layout yes sir yes sir so i have not shown that layer to you of yourself yes hello so what you how you make a tap is if you have to make a substrate connection for the evil then instead of n plus you will make a p plus region and in that you will only make an active and you will connect that actors with ground so now what happens now you what have you done you made this as n plus what not n plus you made this as p plus yes sir and this is p plus so what is happening there is a p well and in this you have made a p plus region so between them there is no d there is no uh depletion region per se oh between the p l and p plus there is simple flow of current that can happen there is no depletion region which will ever come into picture it's not a junction so actually in the layout there was a tutorial so in the tutorial we were said that the n plus and the p plus there or only kind of shows us that what kind of doping has to go there but they are not actually in the layer they are not going to the fabrication they are not being processed yeah yeah so but so i have made active and only have shown the active to be there i have not shown the design related to the p plus layer okay so the p plus layer here is basically telling us that the active will be of the p type right yes okay yeah so so this was the contact actually was that we had to basically uh instantiate using a create via option only ptap in the virtuoso but for the above for the pmos we for the same kind of to do that we had to use a m1 and po m1 no sir m1 po sorry uh it was m1 invel m1 and value because what you need to do there is you need to in the n well you need to create an n plus active region and then n plus to n well there is a direct flow of charge there is no junction there just sir so but this is not technically a vr right no this is not via okay yeah there's the option option it was coming in the vr so okay yes it got it option was showing via actually whatever it was okay so it is not a vr if you in an interview you say via they will say you don't know anything about vlsi so why is that it does not go to fabrication i mean for providing a condition to substrate we need a we need this n plus or p plus yeah yeah so this is information at the time of so you will not see an artifact of nps layer on silicon can you you made this let us say you made this n plus or p plus layer over here would you see anything like in this in this cross section view do you see anywhere where the n plus is ending and p plus is starting can you see an artifact on silicon not in this diagram but it should be like this in any diagram you will not see that n plus mask is required therefore you need to make this but otherwise after that mask nothing else only active region is what is get what will get doped other part is field oxide there will be no impact on it so the active region is what will you will see on silicon and the mask for the n plus and p plus is much larger than that active region active region gets the doping so this is real dopings that are going on silicon yeah they are dupings but you cannot see the artifact of n plus layer the layer that you made over here this will not appear on silicon this layer will not appear on silicon it will only appear as that the the doping of the active enclosed within the send plus layer is n and type okay so that this this particular region has a higher doping than yes that the doping over here is n type and the doping on the p plus region is p type that is the only thing you can deduce but you will not be able to see an artifact of this layer on silica okay so and each one of these each one of each one of these is also connected to the vcc or ground whichever doping is yes so we were coming to

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,Hyej-EEgy5o,when i was making the inverter so i what i did to reduce the height so i i did that i put the both the nmos and pimas side by side and so after that i made the connections and i i had some space for nba sorry the tabs also so i also made those steps inside that periphery only so after that actually sir i had to make the pp and np layer parallel to each other there but vertically vertically parallel sim normally what we do is we we make it horizontally parallel so who who gave okay so i will tell you what what actually happens so let us look at how the template of the of the least cell is made you say that i will not make any taps in the in my every cell because the drc says that there should be a tap every 30 microns so if i make a tap in every cell then i am unnecessarily over compensating or overusing the drc the drc requires once every 30 microns if i'm making a tap continuously then i'm wasting lots of area so i simply put a metal one and i say this will carry ground on the top i put a metal one and i say this will carry vdd okay and this vdd thickness or ground thickness you can say is 2x 2x x means minimum wire width okay and then what you say is half of this thickness will go on the other side from will come from the other cell and half i will keep in mind so you say that okay this is how my cell height would look like okay then what you also do is you make an envel you make it such that so now you make an envel this is your template now what you will do is you will make devices over here and you will make those poly poly regions stuff like that okay so what are we talking about over here if i had to make a much bigger device i would simply break it into multiple fingers like i have made the nmos in three fingers and pmos and two fingers over here nmos and two fingers and the femors and one finger over here so how do i decide this height any idea sir uh do we know that i'm like previously do we know what are the sizes of pmos and nmos are exactly so that um no you do not know how will you decide this height so actually i asked this the the height of the standard salary decided based upon the that that so are all of you attending office hours also yes sir but this it has not got to this advance earlier we were having tools related tools were not working so till now that only yes okay so see what happens is uh when we make this wall you remember the wall of standard cells that we were talking about this wall so what do i need to do i need to connect a flip flop from here with a you know a flip flop from here with a buffer over there i need to connect something you know some input of this flip flop with the adjacent cell some input of this adjacent cell with an adjacent cell some input from here would come from here and so on and that is how your connectivity would be made all these these walls on these these regions that you're talking about are basically your and gates nand gates buffers and so on so based on what your circuit is you will need to make connections every here they are everywhere yes sir so these connections uh cannot be made in metal one why cannot we made a metal one because metal one we have already blocked over here like this i know so metal one you cannot route over and you know you cannot with metal one you cannot cross from one one layer to another one layer matlab knee one row to another because metal one is blocked so what do you do you will use metal two metal three another higher level of metals to connect between different rows of these standard cells are you with me till now so i mean so different rows of standard cell okay okay okay different standard cells right right yeah yeah these are three i have shown three rows over here okay yeah and so one thing's just here only in the middle one that you have drawn common in that only you're saying that in that metal one only uh 30 micron spacing we have to put a ptappy tab right you're seeing that yeah we will come to that oh yes we will come to that okay so what are we saying so we will use metal two metal c and other metals to do this routing between these cells am i right so how many how many such cells would you do you think they will be in any design let us say an intel processor how many such cells would be there do you know millions of them millions of them you know in the total chip there would be millions of such cells in any macro small processor there would still be uh thousands if not lacks of them okay so you have to connect cells across thousands of cells and so many cells so you will need lots of wires to run around huh yes sir so we say that this height should be such that sufficient number of wires can run over these cells okay so the height is determined by how many wires do you want to run so there could be a 12 track library what does 12 track means that 12 wires of metal two can run over the cell now let us consider let us say in 65 nanometer wire width minimum wire width is what is your minimum drc for wire width it is 0.9 0.2 nanometers and minimum wire spacing is again 90 nanometer almost i know so if i have to make two wires or if i have to similarly make multiple wires what would happen to make one wire i have to give a spacing of 180 nanometer okay this is also called pitch right this is pitch so for one track i need 180 nanometer height i have to make 12 tracks what would be the height 180 to 12 so 2.16 microns are you able to see this for a 12 track library the height from this point to this point is 2.16 and every structure that you make inside this this height should leave half drc from this this boundary which is called as pr boundary so at this point i'm not able to get this pr boundary point what exactly mean by that this is the perimeter boundary you may say then adjacent cell will come and abut at the perimeter boundary when we were calculating the height over here we said half drc of poly to polyspacing has to be kept yes because the adjacent cell will also leave half drc i will leave half drc so all the structures should have half drc from the pr boundary if i ensure that in every cell my entire system will be drc clean so this half drc is between the poly and the metal wire that is running right no pr boundary okay so i mean can you show in this only where this metal one is coming right and that okay so in this metal one would be coming would be coming let us say here half above this boundary half below this boundary okay and okay so since this metal is also like shade between different cells this metal ground yeah viridian ground can be shared so sir here i am having two kind of dishes one is that i have to maintain with the poly of one cells and other cell and also this wire thickness right there will be some that yeah thickness that is not a drc that is how you placed it okay but so there would be some minimum uh thickness of the wire right that but like you have to maintain okay so but there is no like drc between the metal and the poly this no there are different layers okay metal one is different layer poly is in different layer okay and that we saw in the fabrication steps also now yeah yeah okay so you link it with all the previous lectures and so just with just a trivia so this metal one is interconnected with this poly via tungsten right because that is the base no this is vdd this vdd will not be connected to the poly vdd will be connected to source and drain yeah yeah okay i know so there is there is this uh metal one that is running down there and that is how this this region will get its ground there is this metal one running up here that is how this region will get their vdd okay but this metal one and that connection is between uh tungsten right yeah this yellows are timestamps yeah yeah okay they are contacts contacts are tungsten like metal one is running above the active region so there would be some kind of vertical aggression also now that is also that we don't call up the year no okay that is true whatever you want to make a connection you have to make a contact otherwise it just runs through runs above it it's like a flyover when you want to have a connection you make a pillar okay there's this span from below which many things can run that pillar itself is a contact right right yeah yeah oh excuse me sir yes can you please go to the previous diagram on the right hand side yeah so what are these these by so we were talking about these bodies that are in between metal metal this ground and vdd so yeah we were talking about some constraint on these bias minimum spacing i didn't get that one so we were talking about how many wires can i run from above one cell so these wires are also on metal one here now they will metal two so the metal one is only for vdd in gram by nothing we really drowned all the local connections see all these local connections we made in metal one only now all these local connections are also in metal one we made this local connections in metal one only yes sir so this is not just vdd on ground all the local connections are also metal one so metal one is blocked metal one is blocked if you want to route anything around here you have to use metal two so why is exactly that i'm sorry can you do it without shorting no that is why it is blocked accident yes sir so you need to go by the flyover okay so this metallic one is above this all these cells like i'm quite not able to visualize this in 3d what do you mean by above all these cells like these cells are in a horizontal plane then we have above them we have metal one and above that we have metal two yeah so look at this so we make contacts vertical contacts yes this is the sidewall this is the cross section view yes so then there will be a metal one connecting these ones and there will be a different metal one connecting these ones okay okay okay what about the minimum spacing that you have to ensure the rc so you always have to ensure now that you cannot do away with it and we are talking about that i'm sorry so we are talking about these spacings in metal yes because metal two are the number of wires that you can carry above the cell which are passed through so if if there are 12 wires that have to cross each wire has to be at least minimum width and there should be a minimum spacing between them now yes so yeah so here we are saying we it is 12 tracks like we can have 12 wires so like in between metal one ground and metal when vdd we have this distance in which we look but so why is it why we are calling it as height what do you want to call it the distance between two metals okay call it distance between two metals how do what difference does it make see we're talking about this wall hello we're talking about this wall so i said that i will want to call this the height of one brick as height you want to call it distance between two metals you call it two decisions your choice so actually i want to use lesser words okay okay so this high technology was quite confusing for me to visualize the uh these things in 3d that is why i was asking so this is heightened 2d cells 2d center okay okay sir yes sir uh yes sir so there was a metal running above the stand i'm like above one cell and below one cell right sir so uh for suppose we are giving uh pdd for the above one and the ground for the below one so the the cell adjacent to this i am not the cell below this uh the same cell would be repeating right sir so the cell below this and like how how is it using vdd sir i'm like because the pmos of of that is even oh no if you will not use what did we do over here what did we do over here we said source drain and then for the other cell it is drain and source similarly for one cell you will say let us say this is running vdd we know that the other one is running ground then you know this is running vdd and this is running ground what is the big deal some cells are vertically placed other cells are flipping but flip okay yeah uh and one more doubt so this i'm like uh this small dot so uh sir as we are doing only for it it's for one cell right sir so uh the uh this um like uh the software which we use it uh automatically knows that we have to flip this cell uh i'm like uh because we don't look for uh one right so okay okay thank you so the tool will do it the tool will do it don't worry thank you okay so now taps ourselves we talked about the height of these cells and everything what about taps excuse me sir one more thing is that this height is composed of bit of bmos and inverse no no this height is coming from how many tracks you are running through it this height if i have four tracks the height will be four w plus four s okay okay so this height is also in the middle so is cell is defined by number of metal height of this two tracks you can run above it now it's a two dimensional height right so this is the breakdown that we talked about this brick wall that we talked about that is also regarding metal ones or is it regarding standard cells that is standard cell scale bricks so each each standard cell you will consider as a brick in that wall and so the height we are talking about in this diagram and height that would probably be that they are different that it's not letting me zoom so you see this i had made so this is the height this is the height of one stand itself so the height of until here is three h because you put three bricks one over another yes sir and these bricks are off pmos or in most work there will be one simple these bricks have p masses and n masses both there is a p mass here and there's an n mos here okay so anna yes sir and why is the side then uh is only constrained by the number of wires that we can put in between that is that is how uh that is the uh what do you say that is how it is defined now if you may want to make a wider transistor you make it in fingers okay so it's okay so instead of increasing the height i just cascade raise the number of fingers you increase the width you see that is why different cells have different width in this brick wall okay they have the same height though,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyej-EEgy5o,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hyej-EEgy5o
Transcript: when i was making the inverter so i what i did to reduce the height so i i did that i put the both the nmos and pimas side by side and so after that i made the connections and i i had some space for nba sorry the tabs also so i also made those steps inside that periphery only so after that actually sir i had to make the pp and np layer parallel to each other there but vertically vertically parallel sim normally what we do is we we make it horizontally parallel so who who gave okay so i will tell you what what actually happens so let us look at how the template of the of the least cell is made you say that i will not make any taps in the in my every cell because the drc says that there should be a tap every 30 microns so if i make a tap in every cell then i am unnecessarily over compensating or overusing the drc the drc requires once every 30 microns if i'm making a tap continuously then i'm wasting lots of area so i simply put a metal one and i say this will carry ground on the top i put a metal one and i say this will carry vdd okay and this vdd thickness or ground thickness you can say is 2x 2x x means minimum wire width okay and then what you say is half of this thickness will go on the other side from will come from the other cell and half i will keep in mind so you say that okay this is how my cell height would look like okay then what you also do is you make an envel you make it such that so now you make an envel this is your template now what you will do is you will make devices over here and you will make those poly poly regions stuff like that okay so what are we talking about over here if i had to make a much bigger device i would simply break it into multiple fingers like i have made the nmos in three fingers and pmos and two fingers over here nmos and two fingers and the femors and one finger over here so how do i decide this height any idea sir uh do we know that i'm like previously do we know what are the sizes of pmos and nmos are exactly so that um no you do not know how will you decide this height so actually i asked this the the height of the standard salary decided based upon the that that so are all of you attending office hours also yes sir but this it has not got to this advance earlier we were having tools related tools were not working so till now that only yes okay so see what happens is uh when we make this wall you remember the wall of standard cells that we were talking about this wall so what do i need to do i need to connect a flip flop from here with a you know a flip flop from here with a buffer over there i need to connect something you know some input of this flip flop with the adjacent cell some input of this adjacent cell with an adjacent cell some input from here would come from here and so on and that is how your connectivity would be made all these these walls on these these regions that you're talking about are basically your and gates nand gates buffers and so on so based on what your circuit is you will need to make connections every here they are everywhere yes sir so these connections uh cannot be made in metal one why cannot we made a metal one because metal one we have already blocked over here like this i know so metal one you cannot route over and you know you cannot with metal one you cannot cross from one one layer to another one layer matlab knee one row to another because metal one is blocked so what do you do you will use metal two metal three another higher level of metals to connect between different rows of these standard cells are you with me till now so i mean so different rows of standard cell okay okay okay different standard cells right right yeah yeah these are three i have shown three rows over here okay yeah and so one thing's just here only in the middle one that you have drawn common in that only you're saying that in that metal one only uh 30 micron spacing we have to put a ptappy tab right you're seeing that yeah we will come to that oh yes we will come to that okay so what are we saying so we will use metal two metal c and other metals to do this routing between these cells am i right so how many how many such cells would you do you think they will be in any design let us say an intel processor how many such cells would be there do you know millions of them millions of them you know in the total chip there would be millions of such cells in any macro small processor there would still be uh thousands if not lacks of them okay so you have to connect cells across thousands of cells and so many cells so you will need lots of wires to run around huh yes sir so we say that this height should be such that sufficient number of wires can run over these cells okay so the height is determined by how many wires do you want to run so there could be a 12 track library what does 12 track means that 12 wires of metal two can run over the cell now let us consider let us say in 65 nanometer wire width minimum wire width is what is your minimum drc for wire width it is 0.9 0.2 nanometers and minimum wire spacing is again 90 nanometer almost i know so if i have to make two wires or if i have to similarly make multiple wires what would happen to make one wire i have to give a spacing of 180 nanometer okay this is also called pitch right this is pitch so for one track i need 180 nanometer height i have to make 12 tracks what would be the height 180 to 12 so 2.16 microns are you able to see this for a 12 track library the height from this point to this point is 2.16 and every structure that you make inside this this height should leave half drc from this this boundary which is called as pr boundary so at this point i'm not able to get this pr boundary point what exactly mean by that this is the perimeter boundary you may say then adjacent cell will come and abut at the perimeter boundary when we were calculating the height over here we said half drc of poly to polyspacing has to be kept yes because the adjacent cell will also leave half drc i will leave half drc so all the structures should have half drc from the pr boundary if i ensure that in every cell my entire system will be drc clean so this half drc is between the poly and the metal wire that is running right no pr boundary okay so i mean can you show in this only where this metal one is coming right and that okay so in this metal one would be coming would be coming let us say here half above this boundary half below this boundary okay and okay so since this metal is also like shade between different cells this metal ground yeah viridian ground can be shared so sir here i am having two kind of dishes one is that i have to maintain with the poly of one cells and other cell and also this wire thickness right there will be some that yeah thickness that is not a drc that is how you placed it okay but so there would be some minimum uh thickness of the wire right that but like you have to maintain okay so but there is no like drc between the metal and the poly this no there are different layers okay metal one is different layer poly is in different layer okay and that we saw in the fabrication steps also now yeah yeah okay so you link it with all the previous lectures and so just with just a trivia so this metal one is interconnected with this poly via tungsten right because that is the base no this is vdd this vdd will not be connected to the poly vdd will be connected to source and drain yeah yeah okay i know so there is there is this uh metal one that is running down there and that is how this this region will get its ground there is this metal one running up here that is how this region will get their vdd okay but this metal one and that connection is between uh tungsten right yeah this yellows are timestamps yeah yeah okay they are contacts contacts are tungsten like metal one is running above the active region so there would be some kind of vertical aggression also now that is also that we don't call up the year no okay that is true whatever you want to make a connection you have to make a contact otherwise it just runs through runs above it it's like a flyover when you want to have a connection you make a pillar okay there's this span from below which many things can run that pillar itself is a contact right right yeah yeah oh excuse me sir yes can you please go to the previous diagram on the right hand side yeah so what are these these by so we were talking about these bodies that are in between metal metal this ground and vdd so yeah we were talking about some

actually i want to use lesser words okay okay so this high technology was quite confusing for me to visualize the uh these things in 3d that is why i was asking so this is heightened 2d cells 2d

the tool will do it don't worry thank you okay so now taps ourselves we talked about the height of these cells and everything what about taps excuse me sir one more thing is that this height is

same height though"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,g1jq_Tl89PA,oh okay sir yes sir i have a general question sir so sir uh the unlike the layout which we have made below was for uh a bar b right sir uh i'm like yes sir uh i'm like okay so sir uh my doubt is that uh so when we consider a chip or some thing sir so if uh how does that know that uh how many standard cells should i make of this kind you write an rtr no sir i have i'm like okay okay yes sir yes sir yes sir no so the schematic you will tell i want a nand gate yes that will tell sir but uh uh so like this many number of cells are present right sir so see that was why we covered that vdf pura design flow now yes sir what did we say we will write the rtl we'll simulate it we'll see the functionality is correct then we will go to the synthesis stage in that synthesis stage i will get to know how many nand gates okay so it's pre-defined you cannot forget any of the lectures till now okay okay sir however fluffy they might sound you to be sound sound to you you cannot forget any one of them they are the basis they are the foundation that is the basic understanding on which we are building all this now yes sir i i do understand my doubt is that whenever we write a rtelser so my doubt is that if all this all this is supposed to get into cheap price finally at the uh at the end of the uh end of the task it's supposed to be great and it's supposed to be written into the i'm like it's supposed to be configured on the chip so rtl which we write is uh which we write is uh i'm like uh it's before that right sir so uh so how i'm like uh even in rtl we just write a code that's it i'm like uh what i have seen which we just write a code how how is the hardware i'm like how does that decide key okay i need this many number of nand gates i need this many number of numbers but we we write only one line over there sir yeah see you write one line but there are ten gates that are introduced because of that line i'm like this step is called synthesis so if you simulate a very log and tell me that i know very log i will not pay any heat to what you have told me unless you tell me i have i know how to write verilog and i have synthesized very log into you know 100 gate designs 500 gate designs or 1 million gate designs then i will know okay how complex serialize you can write okay okay sir understood thank you sir okay otherwise very long is simple c language yes sir yes but we call it hardware description language why because we are making hardware out of that yes and that first step of converting that c english language into into something which is closer to vlsi is synthesis okay sir thank you sir certain now we the undergrads have done in eld we have done very long in led so we were focusing mainly on fpgas so we did not much very so we wrote mostly behavioral codes behavioral descriptions and we did not think that uh how many hand gates will it use our how many markets no no but elt maybe you must have seen now this many look up tables are used this much has been used you must have looked at the resources that are getting used yes so you were looking at that yes sir each resistor entry in the lookup table represents some gate you can assume that yes yes one lookup table can be converted into an equivalent combination yes exactly so you're already looking at that you just not realize that this is actually going on silicon also like this this is the first time that i am thinking about that i never thought about reducing the resource utilization to an extent i should think about and gates and power you put the where you put the for loops for loops all at once can be considered as parallelism so generate for loops or combinatorial formats whichever [Music] so if you could if you do not put for loops uh for parts which do not need to be put in parallel or do not need to be replicated you can save area it may increase time to execute a time to execute the entire instruction yes but you will save area yes sir yes that is uh yes instance at this we can save area at the instance level module level area we can say but let us say that i need an adder i just write a single line of verilog c equals to a plus b so now i have no control over how much yes now the fpga which which fbga board you are using that will define which adder is being used yes yes so what do we do in silicon uh so we will come towards the end of this course we will talk about different kinds of adders also don't worry okay so there are there are different kinds of adders some would have lesser areas some would have lesser delay some would have lesser race conditions so i'm looking for that yeah carry look at adder ripple carry adders all those things you will see will not go into too much detail because that is simple combinatorial logic you can always get it see this information you will not get in the books so my intent is i give you this kind of information in the class unfortunately out of 93 students only 35 are attending the class today so i am i am here i am here to offer and give you additional information and answer your queries but you have to be here to ask those questions so my question was where is the strap now we not made the strap here so where does the strap come where do where do we make the tap for the people and the envelope to prevent latch up sir at the end of that drc length 30 yeah so what we say is that if my this wall you know the wall that i have made if this wall is 30 microns so i will simply make uh taps at the boundary of this wall okay or usually my walls would be thousands of microns wide so what do i do i say that okay these are my rows in these i will put tabs at regular intervals you've seen pillars in flowers so those pillars come after regular intervals may so these steps you make after regular intervals so that no point this point no point has a tab which is farther than drc distance away sir yes drc so this one cell that in particular wall is basically a standard cell right no no no no i'm not i've just shown you rows now the standard cells and this would be very small ones so what is what the vertical ones the vertical ones that i have shown in this view are the tabs i should have probably used a different color let me use it actually so so this basically this different kind of for example say i take up one layer only and these different blocks they are basically one standard cells now right no a standard cell for example and this there could be a buffer here there could be a flip flop so actually it's not visible so can you move to the different side because that will be available now yes yes so there could be a buffer here there could be a flip flop here there could be an inverter here there could be a y here so there are so many cells here these dark blue ones that i made they are taps so that is what i am saying the spacing between these tabs these the spacing between these tabs is such that uh so this was a tab this was a tab so the spacing is such that no no active region can be can be there which has a sp has a distance of more than 30 micron from the closest tab so which active region sir in each of these cells there is some active now yes sir yeah yeah so each actor will have some tap within 30 microns of it okay so sir this basically the standard cell that sorry this topology basically we are showing you you're showing the standard cell draws here right yeah i am showing you a uh uh 1000 meter top level view of earth let us say yeah again as you come closer you will see that the standard cell has these active regions in it yes sir but you will see them only when you come closer there are taps and there are these cells so there are these small small cells there are boundaries but as you come closer you will be able to see even identify the cars that are parked outside the house yes sir i've seen google maps no satellite maps in google yeah yes so my question so my question is also this that for example these are standard cell rows right and for example once i have placed this standard cells in these different rows then i am doing the tapping thing yes you can do that or you can actually fixate the tabs first and then place the standard cells in there so because right when we are doing it so this was basically we are doing in placement so after placement the tapping would be done during the placement tapping taps will also be placed okay after i have placed those in the standard cell rows so but like in the layout we are doing with each kind of yeah have you made any tap have i shown any tap over here no sir i know okay because i am saying that at the system level i am taking care of it you don't bother about it at the cell level let us save area okay so basically tapping thing happens automatically by the tool itself so you will have to make a standard cell which is tap type so we'll have to make a standard fill this may tap tap functionality hogi and the tool will place those tabs at regular intervals yeah so but that standard cell i will get in the library format right so you will make that okay those libraries okay just like you're making this nand gate or something over here similarly you will make this tab cell also so so this actually is for example in this only this uh in which you have shown the tell 12 track the height one this diagram only so the tapping the 30 micron is basically the distance between the for example the active of this nmos and this tapping so for example like it happens here cells away okay the tap the substrate connection for this and mass could be 10 cells away okay and it is still fine because it meets my drc requirements okay fine but that has to happen for every active initiative for everything yeah for no active should the tab be farther than the drc distance away okay okay yeah so i have been pressured so there is still one question which is pending as of now the question is from which we started but so one row is consisting of many standard cells right one row yes one row has many standard cells in it and those standard cells uh may consist of uh uh n and die unit like a flip flop or an adder something like that yeah just one row can have uh many sub rows of nmos and pmos no you can have another nmr right here below it provided you are meeting all the drc's you can have multiple rows of n masses enough you have to meet the drc you cannot violate the height answer how are these these rows separated from each other they are not separated there they are abutting that is where you will share the metals now that is where this vdd will be shared with the cell which is flipped and put on the top that there is this vdd then gnd then vdd then gnd so the boundaries of these carry vdd and gnd and they are shared across the top row and the bottom row okay between two tabs there would be many standard cells so in that way i have to share the angle for that many number of standards and also yes and well so the template would be such that this envelope will continue from the left to the right this envel will continue from left to the right so sir that is why it is not advised to make np and pp parallel to each other vertically right yes the first question where should the the drain which which should be connected to output and which should be connected to vdd yeah animation please sorry so i was asking the same question you're asking the same question you don't have an answer yet no no still not okay debris sir actually had one question that suppose the length of the row is three times the size of the drc for minimum length from where the strap is to be kept so if it is two times the drc then you can keep at keep at two ends but if it is three times then all right in that case what is run you will put two straps uh like you will how do i will show you so if the total length is 3 3x so what you will do you will put a strap here you will put a strap here x x x in fact this can be x by 2 2x and x by 2. okay something like that between two two rows somehow we have to add just between two rows name within a row you will put it okay so what is this trap he's talking about divgy the the n plus and p plus connections for the substrate taps tabs are also called straps okay right multiple names so see we are all out to confuse you yeah we are all out to confuse you so uh it's okay don't worry ask ask if you get confused so it's important to attend the class yeah so before going to the answer of the question i also wanted to ask that till now the when you started the real question the only factor other factor i was thinking about of the diffusion capacitance right but for example in the mosfet capacitance when you're modeling it weeks out of three kind of capacitance one was that from the gate to the either source of the drain one from from the gate to the channel and one from both the diffusion capacitance so like so why we are not considering the gate to the channel capacitance or other two capacitors when we were comparing this topology with this one original one that i had made what did we say we counted the number of gate to contact capacitances we counted all the capacitances there yeah yes actually so now so one thing so we are not talked about this uh gate to the channel okay so that that is basically controlled by the specification that someone has given yeah that is that as a designer you saw that you want a 5 micron device or a 7 micron device how can at the layout state you change that requirement so sir uh as of now i can see that the as a designer the most important that i control is the active region and the contacts if i can share it i can reduce the contacts if i share it we can reduce the diffusion capacitance but only the active region i'm considering it for example that is only the thing that i'm we're focusing on like most of our time to control that okay and within this active region the diffusion capacitor is the most important that's like for focusing on that it seems to be right yeah so now tell me this is my nand gate palette two devices cooper p moses and h and so which one should be ground which one should be so this is uh since we're just making a stick diagram corresponding to this one so this is ground so i make a wire to ground over here connected to ground and this is my output my voltage sorry this is my ground because b connects to ground and this is my output now where should this metal one go should it go to this one or should it go to the boundary ones your middle one sir why sir uh because sir that's obvious right sir if we give to the leftmost connection then we won't consider this right most uh no we saw now we can connect it like this so if i take it to this one i will take the middle one and do it like this yes sir i can't do it it is not obvious it is not obvious because of that reason what you are telling me it could be obvious because of some other reason the side of my standard cell i do not want two vdd coming out why i mean from the standard seller design so i have to attach to the rail railing that will be really going up up there so i could make two connections what's the big deal so if i say that i if i say that this is my output then this will go to vdd this will go to vdd what's the big deal there is a metal running here what's the big deal of that so the sidewall capacitance would play a role over here because we need to connect uh the input to the contact that is in uh that is between the two gates okay so you're saying this is how you should make it yes sir is everyone agree in agreement with this yes sir what happened yeah can we and i also think about signal integrity because because this metal one is crossing the poly two times there and here we can also do it one time okay so what is it that you really want anyways see what are these poly this is signal a this is signal b this is out so anyway if you even if you look at the schematic over here if you look at the schematic over there you will see there is some coupling capacitance between b and out there is already something there yes why is there something you tell me because a and out there is this drain capacitance there is this contact to poly capacitance everything is already there so that will add some capacitance i'm not saying it will not have any capacitor so there is already so much capacitance out there that a and y already have right so what's the big deal if you use this as the output what happens output capacitance reduces if you were using this as the output there would be extra drain and source capacitance that you would have to bear we have 20 fentanyl you are adding more capacitance on the load then so that so addition is due to the side wall only that yes not just sidewall we also did the calculation on uh the arianna so but either you said we are taking to be like the same no we calculated that this one this one would be 140 nanometer extension this one would be 140 nanometer extension so total extension will be 280 280 nanometer into wp over here the central area would be 160 into wp we calculated this we started with the assumption but i then gave you the exact calculation that is so less okay so we are considering two thing that one after the sharing the of the active regions then we are placing it between so two to reduce that yes okay right see again in the lecture we progress i start with an assumption but then i clarified that assumption is invalid in fact when you do sharing you save area and when you save area you are also sharing source entrained uh capacitances you are saving on that also so source and twin is a diffusion one right yes yeah okay so we have the answer to the first question where we started from and we did not even open one slide today,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1jq_Tl89PA,"Link:

Transcript: oh okay sir yes sir i have a general question sir so sir uh the unlike the layout which we have made below was for uh a bar b right sir uh i'm like yes sir uh i'm like okay so sir uh my doubt is that uh so when we consider a chip or some thing sir so if uh how does that know that uh how many standard cells should i make of this kind you write an rtr no sir i have i'm like okay okay yes sir yes sir yes sir no so the schematic you will tell i want a nand gate yes that will tell sir but uh uh so like this many number of cells are present right sir so see that was why we covered that vdf pura design flow now yes sir what did we say we will write the rtl we'll simulate it we'll see the functionality is correct then we will go to the synthesis stage in that synthesis stage i will get to know how many nand gates okay so it's pre-defined you cannot forget any of the lectures till now okay okay sir however fluffy they might sound you to be sound sound to you you cannot forget any one of them they are the basis they are the foundation that is the basic understanding on which we are building all this now yes sir i i do understand my doubt is that whenever we write a rtelser so my doubt is that if all this all this is supposed to get into cheap price finally at the uh at the end of the uh end of the task it's supposed to be great and it's supposed to be written into the i'm like it's supposed to be configured on the chip so rtl which we write is uh which we write is uh i'm like uh it's before that right sir so uh so how i'm like uh even in rtl we just write a code that's it i'm like uh what i have seen which we just write a code how how is the hardware i'm like how does that decide key okay i need this many number of nand gates i need this many number of numbers but we we write only one line over there sir yeah see you write one line but there are ten gates that are introduced because of that line i'm like this step is called synthesis so if you simulate a very log and tell me that i know very log i will not pay any heat to what you have told me unless you tell me i have i know how to write verilog and i have synthesized very log into you know 100 gate designs 500 gate designs or 1 million gate designs then i will know okay how complex serialize you can write okay okay sir understood thank you sir okay otherwise very long is simple c language yes sir yes but we call it hardware description language why because we are making hardware out of that yes and that first step of converting that c english language into into something which is closer to vlsi is synthesis okay sir thank you sir certain now we the undergrads have done in eld we have done very long in led so we were focusing mainly on fpgas so we did not much very so we wrote mostly behavioral codes behavioral descriptions and we did not think that uh how many hand gates will it use our how many markets no no but elt maybe you must have seen now this many look up tables are used this much has been used you must have looked at the resources that are getting used yes so you were looking at that yes sir each resistor entry in the lookup table represents some gate you can assume that yes yes one lookup table can be converted into an equivalent combination yes exactly so you're already looking at that you just not realize that this is actually going on silicon also like this this is the first time that i am thinking about that i never thought about reducing the resource utilization to an extent i should think about and gates and power you put the where you put the for loops for loops all at once can be considered as parallelism so generate for loops or combinatorial formats whichever [Music] so if you could if you do not put for loops uh for parts which do not need to be put in parallel or do not need to be replicated you can save area it may increase time to execute a time to execute the entire instruction yes but you will save area yes sir yes that is uh yes instance at this we can save area at the instance level module level area we can say but let us say that i need an adder i just write a single line of verilog c equals to a plus b so now i have no control over how much yes now the fpga which which fbga board you are using that will define which adder is being used yes yes so what do we do in silicon uh so we will come towards the end of this course we will talk about different kinds of adders also don't worry okay so there are there are different kinds of adders some would have lesser areas some would have lesser delay some would have lesser race conditions so i'm looking for that yeah carry look at adder ripple carry adders all those things you will see will not go into too much detail because that is simple combinatorial logic you can always get it see this information you will not get in the books so my intent is i give you this kind of information in the class unfortunately out of 93 students only 35 are attending the class today so i am i am here i am here to offer and give you additional information and answer your queries but you have to be here to ask those questions so my question was where is the strap now we not made the strap here so where does the strap come where do where do we make the tap for the people and the envelope to prevent latch up sir at the end of that drc length 30 yeah so what we say is that if my this wall you know the wall that i have made if this wall is 30 microns so i will simply make uh taps at the boundary of this wall okay or usually my walls would be thousands of microns wide so what do i do i say that okay these are my rows in these i will put tabs at regular intervals you've seen pillars in flowers so those pillars come after regular intervals may so these steps you make after regular intervals so that no point this point no point has a tab which is farther than drc distance away sir yes drc so this one cell that in particular wall is basically a standard cell right no no no no i'm not i've just shown you rows now the standard cells and this would be very small ones so what is what the vertical ones the vertical ones that i have shown in this view are the tabs i should have probably used a different color let me use it actually so so this basically this different kind of for example say i take up one layer only and these different blocks they are basically one standard cells now right no a standard cell for example and this there could be a buffer here there could be a flip flop so actually it's not visible so can you move to the different side because that will be available now yes yes so there could be a buffer here there could be a flip flop here there could be an inverter here there could be a y here so there are so many cells here these dark blue ones that i made they are taps so that is what i am saying the spacing between these tabs these the spacing between these tabs is such that uh so this was a tab this was a tab so the spacing is such that no no active region can be can be there which has a sp has a distance of more than 30 micron from the closest tab so which active region sir in each of these cells there is some active now yes sir yeah yeah so each actor will have some tap within 30 microns of it okay so sir this basically the standard cell that sorry this topology basically we are showing you you're showing the standard cell draws here right yeah i am showing you a uh uh 1000 meter top level view of earth let us say yeah again as you come closer you will see that the standard cell has these active regions in it yes sir but you will see them only when you come closer there are taps and there are these cells so there are these small small cells there are boundaries but as you come closer you will be able to see even identify the cars that are parked outside the house yes sir i've seen google maps no satellite maps in google yeah yes so my question so my question is also this that for example these are standard cell rows right and for example once i have placed this standard cells in these different rows then i am doing the tapping thing yes you can do that or you can actually fixate the tabs first and then place the standard cells in there so because right when we are doing it so this was basically we are doing in placement so after placement the tapping would be done during the placement tapping taps will also be placed okay after i have placed those in the standard cell rows so but like in the layout we are doing with each kind of yeah have you made any tap have i shown any tap over here no sir i know okay because i am saying that at the system level i am taking care of it you don't bother about it at the cell level let us save area okay so basically tapping thing happens automatically by the tool itself so you will have to make a standard cell which is tap type so we'll have to make a standard fill this may tap tap functionality hogi and the tool will place those tabs at regular intervals yeah so but that standard cell i will get in the library format right so you will make that okay those libraries okay just like you're making this nand gate or something over here similarly you will make this tab cell also so so this actually is for example in this only this uh in which you have shown the tell 12 track the height one this diagram only so the tapping the 30 micron is basically the distance between the for example the active of this nmos and this tapping so for example like it happens here cells away okay the tap the substrate connection for this and mass could be 10 cells away okay and it is still fine because it meets my drc requirements okay fine but that has to happen for every active initiative for everything yeah for no active should the tab be farther than the drc distance away okay okay yeah so i have been pressured so there is still one question which is pending as of now the question is from which we started but so one row is consisting of many standard cells right one row yes one row has many standard cells in it and those standard cells uh may consist of uh uh n and die unit like a flip flop or an adder something like that yeah just one row can have uh many sub rows of nmos and pmos no you can have another nmr right here below it provided you are meeting all the drc's you can have multiple rows of n masses enough you have to meet the drc you cannot violate the height answer how are these these rows separated from each other they are not separated there they are abutting that is where you will share the metals now that is where this vdd will be shared with the cell which is flipped and put on the top that there is this vdd then gnd then vdd then gnd so the boundaries of these carry vdd and gnd and they are shared across the top row and the bottom row okay between two tabs there would be many standard cells so in that way i have to share the angle for that many number of standards and also yes and well so the template would be such that this envelope will continue from the left to the right this envel will continue from left to the right so sir that is why it is not advised to make np and pp parallel to each other vertically right yes the first question where should the the drain which which should be connected to output and which should be connected to vdd yeah animation please sorry so i was asking the same question you're asking the same question you don't have an answer yet no no still not okay debris sir actually had one question that suppose the length of the row is three times the size of the drc for minimum length from where the strap is to be kept so if it is two times the drc then you can keep at keep at two ends but if it is three times then all right in that case what is run you will put two straps uh like you will how do i will show you so if the total length is 3 3x so what you will do you will put a strap here you will put a strap here x x x in fact this can be x by 2 2x and x by 2. okay something like that between two two rows somehow we have to add just between two rows name within a row you will put it okay so what is this trap he's talking about divgy the the n plus and p plus connections for the substrate taps tabs are also called straps okay right multiple names so see we are all out to confuse you yeah we are all out to confuse you so uh it's okay don't worry ask ask if you get confused so it's important to attend the class yeah so before going to the answer of the question i also wanted to ask that till now the when you started the real question the only factor other factor i was thinking about of the diffusion capacitance right but for example in the mosfet capacitance when you're modeling it weeks out of three kind of capacitance one was that from the gate to the either source of the drain one from from the gate to the channel and one from both the diffusion capacitance so like so why we are not considering the gate to the channel capacitance or other two capacitors when we were comparing this topology with this one original one that i had made what did we say we counted the number of gate to contact capacitances we counted all the capacitances there yeah yes actually so now so one thing so we are not talked about this uh gate to the channel okay so that that is basically controlled by the specification that someone has given yeah that is that as a designer you saw that you want a 5 micron device or a 7 micron device how can at the layout state you change that requirement so sir uh as of now i can see that the as a designer the most important that i control is the active region and the contacts if i can share it i can reduce the contacts if i share it we can reduce the diffusion capacitance but only the active region i'm considering it for example that is only the thing that i'm we're focusing on like most of our time to control that okay and within this active region the diffusion capacitor is the most important that's like for focusing on that it seems to be right yeah so now tell me this is my nand gate palette two devices cooper p moses and h and so which one should be ground which one should be so this is uh since we're just making a stick diagram corresponding to this one so this is ground so i make a wire to ground over here connected to ground and this is my output my voltage sorry this is my ground because b connects to ground and this is my output now where should this metal one go should it go to this one or should it go to the boundary ones your middle one sir why sir uh because sir that's obvious right sir if we give to the leftmost connection then we won't consider this right most uh no we saw now we can connect it like this so if i take it to this one i will take the middle one and do it like this yes sir i can't do it it is not obvious it is not obvious because of that reason what you are telling me it could be obvious because of some other reason the side of my standard cell i do not want two vdd coming out why i mean from the standard seller design so i have to attach to the rail railing that will be really going up up there so i could make two connections what's the big deal so if i say that i if i say that this is my output then this will go to vdd this will go to vdd what's the big deal there is a metal running here what's the big deal of that so the sidewall capacitance would play a role over here because we need to connect uh the input to the contact that is in uh that is between the two gates okay so you're saying this is how you should make it yes sir is everyone agree in agreement with this yes sir what happened yeah can we and i also think about signal integrity because because this metal one is crossing the poly two times there and here we can also do it one time okay so what is it that you really want anyways see what are these poly this is signal a this is signal b this is out so anyway if you even if you look at the schematic over here if you look at the schematic over there you will see there is some coupling capacitance between b and out there is already something there yes why is there

you were using this as the output there would be extra drain and source capacitance that you would have to bear we have 20 fentanyl you are adding more capacitance on the load then so that so addition is due to the side wall only that yes not just sidewall we also did the calculation on uh the arianna so but either you said we are taking to be like the same no we calculated that this one this one

and when you save area you are also sharing source entrained uh capacitances you are saving on that also so source and twin is a diffusion one right yes yeah okay so we have the answer to the first question where we started from and we did not even open one slide today"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,kn9vJ1U2M0Y,[Music] so basically there is some amount of dishing that happens in the copper since it is very tactile so this kind of small small tubs or maybe thank you so what is happening over here is that uh oh yes this thing has again got stuck it seems just give me a moment so when we do the fabrication process now when we are fabricating devices or whatever so what happens is that at some point of time you will do chemo mechanical polishing in which what we essentially do is we flatten out the surfaces okay and in that flattening out the surfaces there is a mechanical force that is also applied so when that mechanical force is applied so when we are polishing so this is the surface of the wafer and we are kind of applying some mechanical force scrubbing it also so what happens when you are scrubbing the floor or something but the dirt or the uneven surface on the top will become polished will move out and you will have something which is clean stable flat now if it is if the surface that you are polishing is uh how do we put it if the surface that you're polishing is of same mechanical strength then what happens then when you polish everywhere the depth or the the the amount of surface removed from the top is almost the same what does that mean that means that your surface remains flat however in copper we understand that we also have this thin layer of barriers that is put around the thin layer of barrier that is put around copper you remember that yes sir so this barrier has much higher mechanical strength than copper so what does this do this barrier then starts to stay strong whereas others other parts of the system kind of get scrubbed okay so i'm trying to bring my slides back to you but it's somehow not working so i wanted to show that to you others i will go to whiteboard and show it so you're able to see my whiteboard yes so what is happening here is that you have this copper barrier hello yeah alright so you have this copper barrier i think they don't want the system doesn't want me to take thing up so i have this copper barrier and i have filled copper inside it let's use a color there i felt copper inside it inside it means i just did the deposition of copper copper filled everywhere and over here i also have what i call as silicon dioxide okay so this region is silicon dioxide you are able to see this episcopal silicon dioxide can be fences to deposit copper and make copper wires all this we've discussed in the fabrication section so we deposited copper and now we want to remove the excess copper so what we do is we run a cmp process through which we say this extra copper will get removed and as we do it we understand there is one mechanical strength of the oxide there is another mechanical strength of the copper and there is a very different mechanical strength with which the barrier holds its level so what happens is that if i have a very thin wire it works fine consider a case i have a very wide wire there is oxide here there is oxide here and there is copper that is filled here so in a very thin wire a cmp machine would come a cmp machine let me show it with what color let me show it with green color over here okay the cmp machine would come and with this barrier and with this barrier it will it will kind of stop there itself whereas when it is a thick metal wire then the cmp machine this barrier will stop it from going deeper over here also on the edge the barrier will stop it from scraping extra copper but in the middle because copper is much softer than the barrier and you are applying some particular force the cmp machine will go deeper so the final copper that you will get is not a flat metal there okay the final copper that you will get will have this kind of a structure hello okay so what so this this is called as dishing okay so are you able to realize what is happening if dishing happens are you okay with it or is there some challenge that you will face as a circuit designer so resistance of bias increase yes see you made you've made a wide wire what was the purpose of making a wide wire because you wanted its resistance to be less but what happened because you made a wide wire there was dishing that happened and the effective resistance did not decrease as much as you wanted it too so yes sir but like uh when you're discussing the wires so there was one uh concept for use aspect ratio and in you that you said that the for the advanced technologies that is higher so by that mean this basically t would be much higher than the weight so this this car this basically effect should be less advanced technologies yeah that is the case now we're talking about the same technology see over here the width is so much lesser than the height is it not yes sir so this this width is let us say 50 nanometer huh but this width that i am talking about is 1 micron so when the width is one micron the depth will not change now that's the technology so that this the one micron you're talking about so these are different metal layers you're talking about no no no no same metal you can make wider metals than the minimum drc now yes sir so but then i just made a wider metal so that i have lesser resistance so but then uh in the when the width is one micron then the height will be also much more than that it's the asterisk maintained so what what do you what can you maintain in a technology can you maintain the depth in which to which you will make the holes in silicon dioxide or you want you will be able to maintain the aspect ratio what is it that you will maintain in the technology you've seen the fabrication process henna we've covered the fabrication process so what was the fabrication process we said we will deposit oxide then we will put masks at some places huh and then we will expose uv radiations we will do something at some places the mass would remain other places the mass would not remain so wherever the mask remain let us say we would now make holes so would you now decide to make holes based on the based on the size of the mask or you will make holes based on your technology specifications masks masks say so if i have a wider hole you say i will go deeper oh depth depth is not dependent on mass depth cannot be dependent on master only the width with which we are width of the mask which are placing that so that is what i am saying this depth is fixed so sir for a particular technology that aspect ratio doesn't have to remain the same for like that you're saying that that is a decision aspect ratio for the minimum wire will remain constant for the technology but for the minimum wire we always talk when we talked about aspect ratio we're talking about minimum wires placed next to each other but not you will not make only minimum wires on your designs now you are worried about resistances okay so like as i go up the metal layers then the aspect pressure won't remain no i'm not even talking about up the metal layers i'm simply talking about even in your standard cell you are making those vdd and gnd rails i said they are 2x the minimum width did i not say that yes yes sir so do you think the depths will also be twice so i mean every depth is decided by their technology right the depth will remain same now yeah so if that remains same what happens for very wide wires this is how this is how it would appear like yeah okay so aspect ratio was only for the minimum kind of basically to give a understanding this is the thickness of the wire that is how we calculate the sheet resistance now remember yes sir heat resistance was rho by h this is h now that will not change depending whether your wire is thicker or thinner yes hannah this edge remains constant this is h here and this is h here both the places yes okay so now what do you do you do not want this dishing it's not clear we do not want this dishing to happen so what do we do what can you do physically ranjit you are saying something uh sir we should go for uh less wide open no but then the resistance would anyways increase i want low resistance only oh sorry if the width is reduced then the resistance okay resistance again so it will run what can you do yes sir i've shown in the image we can just i'm like make it as a different tub and like upper side it should be small and the lower side it should be big and it should be the resistance but again you want it to have a wide wire so that your resistance reduces but the other resistance map is better yeah what do we do we don't want this introduce more barriers wow good nickel how do we introduce more barrier you're going in the right direction nikhil we want to make the roof now and the roof is sagging what do you do in between yes you will put a pillar in between so what is done then is that in the metals when i have very my wide metals running there is a drc that you will see which is called as slotting so i have to make such slots very thin slots okay so what happens i get oxide and barriers over here both okay and they give the required mechanical strength to my system okay this is called as slotting so but how did this solve the problem because then it is again reducing the copper area yeah but effectively what happens is that the copper area reduces only by this much and that do not always do you realize this over here i still get full width so what happens is that after slotting you will see that the this width this depth will not happen it will be almost okay so what will happen is this let me use the same color this will be now almost like this does that in between there is some little block somewhere so effectively your width was then not 1 micron your width was let us say 0.98 micron but what we were experiencing earlier was that overall resistance has increased by more than 40 percent also because of dishing so one banana like in banana point six now by using the slotting you are limited it to only two to three percent so there is a loss clearly there is a loss but it is much lesser than the loss you would get because of dishing so yes serena technology when we define the width of wire width so that is dependent upon how fine uh things i can make on the silicon that is the minimum environment yes so since this barrier would also have some drc yes yeah so there is drc link to slotting you will see that so does that not really stretch the limits of technology in which i am so big so be it we are a designer we can ask for anything under the sun let's do that that's a technology team enable it job technology team up they know we can't do it then we will see okay uh so thank you guys we will start with the inverter part in the next class and thanks for a very good candid discussion today and uh i hope this is a this turns out to be a very good learning experience for all of us okay so yes sir the floating that we are doing in this uh copper wire is it on the surface or it is inside the copper inside the copper i make barriers over here so i will make 10 thin oxides oxide pillars in between okay so this is top view and this is you may say cross section view saw yeah yeah so so can we do anything else i mean like we are doing slotting to avoid dishing so can we do something like we can use uh like the polishing thing you said with something which doesn't like give us this uh this concave or this shape in the copper i mean it flattens it completely i mean yeah that would be nice that would be nice but we don't have that kind of technology yet and this is also cheap enough so that is what is implemented yeah so in this floating four structures that we made inside the sir couldn't we make just the structure that was effectively appearing on the surface so that the effective width for the uh cmd machine would have decreased but yeah inside still we are using some technique to manufacture this this is like this is like going outside making holes around oxide this is the standard process now you are saying that okay i have processes to make these holes i have processes to make these holes i also want some floating stuff to be made never now how would you make that floating stuff there sir it is still made in this force floating diagram that you shown to us i'm sorry there is some immigration going on at my place yeah you're saying something sir it was still made sir in the first floating diagram so can't you just remove those three slotting points inside the copper no they're not made on the surface shivam they are made in the copper in this copper you will have to have this barrier there this barrier will give the mechanical strength and there will be oxide inside it so it will actually be in the copper you have copper on all sides and this is what will happen this is how it will appear this cross section said this barrier would also be a conducting but harder uh harder metal barrier is very resistive it does not conduct as good as copper it is very resistive yes moment sir after slotting will this not affect the resistance of the wire because we have introduced the battery moment when we set this back instead of 0.6 okay so we are compensating by this so it can actually stand but much lesser than dishing sir hello yeah yes sir so sir when you are presenting the slide sir i i saw that the barrier sorry the barrier was a bit of in a triangular shape or it was not in rectangle but it was a trapezoid uh yeah yeah that is a fabrication inaccuracy don't worry about that okay okay okay thank you it is not intended to be that it becomes that because of fabrication and accuracy okay thank,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn9vJ1U2M0Y,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn9vJ1U2M0Y
Transcript: [Music] so basically there is some amount of dishing that happens in the copper since it is very tactile so this kind of small small tubs or maybe thank you so what is happening over here is that uh oh yes this thing has again got stuck it seems just give me a moment so when we do the fabrication process now when we are fabricating devices or whatever so what happens is that at some point of time you will do chemo mechanical polishing in which what we essentially do is we flatten out the surfaces okay and in that flattening out the surfaces there is a mechanical force that is also applied so when that mechanical force is applied so when we are polishing so this is the surface of the wafer and we are kind of applying some mechanical force scrubbing it also so what happens when you are scrubbing the floor or something but the dirt or the uneven surface on the top will become polished will move out and you will have something which is clean stable flat now if it is if the surface that you are polishing is uh how do we put it if the surface that you're polishing is of same mechanical strength then what happens then when you polish everywhere the depth or the the the amount of surface removed from the top is almost the same what does that mean that means that your surface remains flat however in copper we understand that we also have this thin layer of barriers that is put around the thin layer of barrier that is put around copper you remember that yes sir so this barrier has much higher mechanical strength than copper so what does this do this barrier then starts to stay strong whereas others other parts of the system kind of get scrubbed okay so i'm trying to bring my slides back to you but it's somehow not working so i wanted to show that to you others i will go to whiteboard and show it so you're able to see my whiteboard yes so what is happening here is that you have this copper barrier hello yeah alright so you have this copper barrier i think they don't want the system doesn't want me to take thing up so i have this copper barrier and i have filled copper inside it let's use a color there i felt copper inside it inside it means i just did the deposition of copper copper filled everywhere and over here i also have what i call as silicon dioxide okay so this region is silicon dioxide you are able to see this episcopal silicon dioxide can be fences to deposit copper and make copper wires all this we've discussed in the fabrication section so we deposited copper and now we want to remove the excess copper so what we do is we run a cmp process through which we say this extra copper will get removed and as we do it we understand there is one mechanical strength of the oxide there is another mechanical strength of the copper and there is a very different mechanical strength with which the barrier holds its level so what happens is that if i have a very thin wire it works fine consider a case i have a very wide wire there is oxide here there is oxide here and there is copper that is filled here so in a very thin wire a cmp machine would come a cmp machine let me show it with what color let me show it with green color over here okay the cmp machine would come and with this barrier and with this barrier it will it will kind of stop there itself whereas when it is a thick metal wire then the cmp machine this barrier will stop it from going deeper over here also on the edge the barrier will stop it from scraping extra copper but in the middle because copper is much softer than the barrier and you are applying some particular force the cmp machine will go deeper so the final copper that you will get is not a flat metal there okay the final copper that you will get will have this kind of a structure hello okay so what so this this is called as dishing okay so are you able to realize what is happening if dishing happens are you okay with it or is there some challenge that you will face as a circuit designer so resistance of bias increase yes see you made you've made a wide wire what was the purpose of making a wide wire because you wanted its resistance to be less but what happened because you made a wide wire there was dishing that happened and the effective resistance did not decrease as much as you wanted it too so yes sir but like uh when you're discussing the wires so there was one uh concept for use aspect ratio and in you that you said that the for the advanced technologies that is higher so by that mean this basically t would be much higher than the weight so this this car this basically effect should be less advanced technologies yeah that is the case now we're talking about the same technology see over here the width is so much lesser than the height is it not yes sir so this this width is let us say 50 nanometer huh but this width that i am talking about is 1 micron so when the width is one micron the depth will not change now that's the technology so that this the one micron you're talking about so these are different metal layers you're talking about no no no no same metal you can make wider metals than the minimum drc now yes sir so but then i just made a wider metal so that i have lesser resistance so but then uh in the when the width is one micron then the height will be also much more than that it's the asterisk maintained so what what do you what can you maintain in a technology can you maintain the depth in which to which you will make the holes in silicon dioxide or you want you will be able to maintain the aspect ratio what is it that you will maintain in the technology you've seen the fabrication process henna we've covered the fabrication process so what was the fabrication process we said we will deposit oxide then we will put masks at some places huh and then we will expose uv radiations we will do something at some places the mass would remain other places the mass would not remain so wherever the mask remain let us say we would now make holes so would you now decide to make holes based on the based on the size of the mask or you will make holes based on your technology specifications masks masks say so if i have a wider hole you say i will go deeper oh depth depth is not dependent on mass depth cannot be dependent on master only the width with which we are width of the mask which are placing that so that is what i am saying this depth is fixed so sir for a particular technology that aspect ratio doesn't have to remain the same for like that you're saying that that is a decision aspect ratio for the minimum wire will remain constant for the technology but for the minimum wire we always talk when we talked about aspect ratio we're talking about minimum wires placed next to each other but not you will not make only minimum wires on your designs now you are worried about resistances okay so like as i go up the metal layers then the aspect pressure won't remain no i'm not even talking about up the metal layers i'm simply talking about even in your standard cell you are making those vdd and gnd rails i said they are 2x the minimum width did i not say that yes yes sir so do you think the depths will also be twice so i mean every depth is decided by their technology right the depth will remain same now yeah so if that remains same what happens for very wide wires this is how this is how it would appear like yeah okay so aspect ratio was only for the minimum kind of basically to give a understanding this is the thickness of the wire that is how we calculate the sheet resistance now remember yes sir heat resistance was rho by h this is h now that will not change depending whether your wire is thicker or thinner yes hannah this edge remains constant this is h here and this is h here both the places yes okay so now what do you do you do not want this dishing it's not clear we do not want this dishing to happen so what do we do what can you do physically ranjit you are saying something uh sir we should go for uh less wide open no but then the resistance would anyways increase i want low resistance only oh sorry if the width is reduced then the resistance okay resistance again so it will run what can you do yes sir i've shown in the image we can just i'm like make it as a different tub and like upper side it should be small and the lower side it should be big and it should be the resistance but again you want it to have a wide wire so that your resistance reduces but the other resistance map is better yeah what do we do we don't want this introduce more barriers wow good nickel how do we introduce more barrier you're going in the right direction nikhil we want to make the roof now and the roof is sagging what do you do in between yes you will put a pillar in between so what is done then is that in the metals when i have very my wide metals running there is a drc that you will see which is called as slotting so i have to make such slots very thin slots okay so what happens i get oxide and barriers over here both okay and they give the required mechanical strength to my system okay this is called as slotting so but how did this solve the problem because then it is again reducing the copper area yeah but effectively what happens is that the copper area reduces only by this much and that do not always do you realize this over here i still get full width so what happens is that after slotting you will see that the this width this depth will not happen it will be almost okay so what will happen is this let me use the same color this will be now almost like this does that in between there is some little block somewhere so effectively your width was then not 1 micron your width was let us say 0.98 micron but what we were experiencing earlier was that overall resistance has increased by more than 40 percent also because of dishing so one banana like in banana point six now by using the slotting you are limited it to only two to three percent so there is a loss clearly there is a loss but it is much lesser than the loss you would get because of dishing so yes serena technology when we define the width of wire width so that is dependent upon how fine uh things i can make on the silicon that is the minimum environment yes so since this barrier would also have some drc yes yeah so there is drc link to slotting you will see that so does that not really stretch the limits of technology in which i am so big so be it we are a designer we can ask for anything under the sun let's do that that's a technology team enable it job technology team up they know we can't do it then we will see okay uh so thank you guys we will start with the inverter part in the next class and thanks for a very good candid discussion today and uh i hope this is a this turns out to be a very good learning experience for all of us okay so yes sir the floating that we are doing in this uh copper wire is it on the surface or it is inside the copper inside the copper i make barriers over here so i will make 10 thin oxides oxide pillars in between okay so this is top view and this is you may say cross section view saw yeah yeah so so can we do anything else i mean like we are doing slotting to avoid dishing so can we do something like we can use uh like the polishing thing you said with something which doesn't like give us this uh this concave or this shape in the copper i mean it flattens it completely i mean yeah that would be nice that would be nice but we don't have that kind of technology yet and this is also cheap enough so that is what is implemented yeah so in this floating four structures that we made inside the sir couldn't we make just the structure that was effectively appearing on the surface so that the effective width for the uh cmd machine would have decreased but yeah inside still we are using some technique to manufacture this this is like this is like going outside making holes around oxide this is the standard process now you are saying that okay i have processes to make these holes i have processes to make these holes i also want some floating stuff to be made never now how would you make that floating stuff there sir it is still made in this force floating diagram that you shown to us i'm sorry there is some immigration going on at my place yeah you're saying something sir it was still made sir in the first floating diagram so can't you just remove those three slotting points inside the copper no they're not made on the surface shivam they are made in the copper in this copper you will have to have this barrier there this barrier will give the mechanical strength and there will be oxide inside it so it will actually be in the copper you have copper on all sides and this is what will happen this is how it will appear this cross section said this barrier would also be a conducting but harder uh harder metal barrier is very resistive it does not conduct as good as copper it is very resistive yes moment sir after slotting will this not affect the resistance of the wire because we have introduced the battery moment when we set this back instead of 0.6 okay so we are compensating by this so it can actually stand but much lesser than dishing sir hello yeah yes sir so sir when you are presenting the slide sir i i saw that the barrier sorry the barrier was a bit of in a triangular shape or it was not in rectangle but it was a trapezoid uh yeah yeah that is a fabrication inaccuracy don't worry about that okay okay okay thank you it is not intended to be that it becomes that because of fabrication and accuracy okay thank"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,_3zsV5VQEMI,okay so today what we are going to do is essentially completing the wire models we discussed wires now we'll look at wire delay models and stuff and then we will start with inverter today okay so uh wires all of us know are are there along the entire chip they run from uh one end of the chip to another these are global wires and then there obviously there are interconnects you also use wires when you design your circuits and everything so that much is you know evident to all of you now with them what is very important to realize is also that as technology is scaling devices are becoming faster because of technology scaling your channel length is reducing so current is increasing or the time to you know the the device current per unit micron square is increasing all that is happening so device delays are becoming lesser however we understand that as the wires come closer their capacitance increases and as they become thinner their resistance also increases so what would be happening to the interconnect delays so we are saying device delays are reducing as technology scales but what happens to the interconnect delays as technology scales so they increase the interconnect delays increase so it is very important to understand how to model interconnect delays in your circuits and what kind of [Music] you know delays can happen because of interconnects so in an advanced soc and where you have possibly long critical paths also uh one data point shows that up to 70 of total delay in a critical path was rc delays so there is a critical path on a global signal this global signal is running from one place to a distant location on the same day and up to 70 of total delay in that critical path was due to wires in in small circuits just about 20 to 30 percent of delay could be because of fires but in big circuits that is the kind of impact or big circuits means big systems up to 70 of delay could be because of rc interconnect okay so uh what i am showing as of now is the most simple or the simplest model of a wire delay so what is it you simply model the capacitance you're not even modeling the resistance of the wire you you club all the capacitance into one c lump and you say that is all it is do you think this is okay sir yes so this c lamp this is a so for example in the earlier slides you showed us the c adjacent and c ground write a figure so so that c lamp is characterizing all those capacitances yeah yeah everything okay so this is let us say this c wire is distributed over 100 microns so c lambda summing of all those there was a intra metal capacitance there was intermediate capacitance there was metal to substrate capacitance all of that is added and put our sea lump okay so do you think this is accurate no sir no no why first thing we already i just mentioned that resistances are not taken care of at all and uh just the driver resistance is brought into picture so when the resistances were less let us say in 189 180 nanometer technology or 250 nanometer technology this model could have worked but today when we are talking about 18 nanometer it no longer works so what do we do we look at the next model the next model is lumped rc model where we say that okay we will also model the resistances but not too many of them okay and we say that the delay or the effective resistance from node i let us say this is node i to node k let us say this is not k would be given as sum of rjs where rj is elements of all that so effectively delay is k from 1 to n c k into r i k so what is uh i'm just not sure if we have an example okay so this is something that is important and i would want you to do some numerical from the question bank that you already have made available on this okay what is important to see is how does rik change when i am talking about delay at node 2 or delay at node i or delay at node 4 okay it is simple you just need to apply this kind of formula and you will get there but i want you to work on some numericals for this these are simple this is simple addition and multiplication can i assume you can do this sir so what you're saying is that 2 4 and one are respectively the different output position output points that i'm taking in this circuit right yeah okay okay could be no one inverter could be driving four four inputs somewhere else okay yeah then an and gate output could be going to two places yes sir and so so one thing i wanted to ask right key for example sir when we have for example severe game having two gates and there's a wire between them so what we talk about the delay happening is for so first of all there is the input pin capacitance of the gate that is driven then there is the wire thing and then there's also the capacitance in in uh intrinsic to the device itself so this this c basically characterizes all of that i just actually i couldn't understand that let us say let us say ci would be the wire of the capacitance and the wire of the you know the the capacitance of the gate also the capacitance including cgd cgs plus cgb everything that is the load that we are putting at that that node node four or node i or anything so because since it's a metal wire so in itself it doesn't have any capacitance but we are mod why why why no sir if you take an individual wire only no there is a substrate on which it will run now okay substrate is ground so there is a there is always a capacitance of even a isolated wire with ground or vdd whatever so i couldn't get that so what you're seeing is so when i draw a wire let us say i made a wire and there is no other material around it because this is just a wire there was some contact uh some via there and there was some other wire through which it was coming and let us forget the capacitance of this part and let us say this is the other part of the wire which or whose capacitance i want to see let us say this is a substrate so if there is no other metal around here to which lines of electric field lines would go then the line of forces would go to the ground so into the substrate right into the substrate so there will be a capacitance with substrate no wire can exist without any capacitance a capacitance value may be less or it could be large that's a different thing uh because even between the inter metal there's silicon dioxide right so it is also there yeah yeah yeah so there would be definitely some capacitance between this all that would be there but method on substrate can be a capacitance if you cut make a cut over here there will be so many lines of forces that you'll be cutting so that will give you a measure of capacitance between these two so but say for example i am taking a metal three wire and it is isolated so i have below it silicon dioxide right yeah so one is the one charge is a dielectric so all this is let us say this is metal three let us say this is method three yes sir okay so this is dielectric yes sir okay now tell me okay a little bit substrate now substrate which could be considered as the other other plate of the capacitor there is this one plate there is the other plate and this other plate is say held at gnd or vdd let us say gnds and vdds substrate level what's the big deal so it is the basic p p substrate right you're talking about yeah uh p substitute our n subset so this is okay we substitute this is n substrate and well okay so but still uh as we go higher up this component will get negligible right yes it will reduce okay it should reduce because what happens is then uh then what happens is that it will reduce simply because there will be other wires which will to which these lines of forces will somewhere you know far away but even then that is closer than what you will see in the ground so these line of forces will dominate them but every isolated wire will have some capacitance because there is current flowing through it so there is bound to the electric field those lines of field would terminate somewhere yeah yes so but like in our model this our delay model we are basically characterizing all the capacitances the inter intra and this also in this one all that is clubbed into this place okay okay so okay and what we are saying is that whenever i had a turn in the wire or wherever i had a you know bifurcation in the wire that is where i also bifurcate my i i kind of make a split and i put the capacitance there and then i have the other resistance coming into picture and so on okay okay got this okay [Music] here if we are talking solely about the wires then in that case this model would not contain the gate capacitances of the mosfets and uh output the intrinsic capacitance at the terminal at the terminal that is 2 4 and ci it would contain the gate because that's the load so sorry if we talk about uh tool maybe so it uses some kind of if you talk about the some tool like for example genus or anything like that does uh a logical thing so those wire load models will not because they're the you do not even know what the output capacitance is but i'm talking up when you're analyzing a circuit when you're analyzing a circuit then this ci or you can what you can do is you can put another c load ahead of it i would rather not do that i would say ci includes that it makes it simpler because they are in parallel anyway so they will be added yes okay good morning good morning actually can i imagine each note to be a gate and grain junction no one okay no these are wires uh so as i just mentioned uh each node let us say this node one or note three they could be places where my wire bifurcated into two parts okay yeah i got that okay so i was basically thinking like what in uh okay now this is only wire delays this is only via delays only at the terminal end i'm saying you can add the load capacitance there otherwise yeah the basically the junction represents a point and where the bifurcates don't use the word junction because junction there is a junction capacitance that we know of if you confuse people so junction i know you are talking about a train junction for example no so don't use the word junction over here you simply say the thing bifurcates so i was trying to imagine like if there are two inverters in series and uh it lay wire leaves from the drain then goes to the gate of the another inverter so yeah there is a resistance up to that wire and then that wire also can that inverter can drive another circuit another another gate so if it is something like this then i would say we are only talking about this part okay yeah there is nothing else there okay okay only when there is something like okay now this goes to a nand gate and from here it also goes to a nor gate somewhere only when there is something like this that we're talking about remaining parts okay now you know because then we are we're adding more parts onto the picture that is when these paths start to figure in otherwise no okay we're talking only about the wire capacitance in this one but uh i would strongly recommend you to do some numericals uh numerical class may this is a simple addition of multiplication i i don't think we need to do the numerical in the class but i would recommend you to do it it's important for you to estimate okay okay yes mother uh so uh i did not understand the equation this path s2i intersection path s2k what is this s okay so uh all paths all paths which are from uh source to output i and from source to output k s stands for source here we are talking about the capacitance only but at the point the the r point the input point where we you have given a pulse there will be an output capacitance of a gate and at the uh 0.2 and 0.4 there would be some like if if this gate is driving some another gates then this point 2 and 4 will have some input capacitance of those gates yes but so we already said that c2 and c4 and ci would include the load capacitance that is what i just suggested or you can put them in parallel or you can put them in parallel okay ci to c2 c4 and ci uh as far as the capacitance the self loading of the driver is concerned you're right it comes into picture so we can put it there but because we are also considering the driver as the source uh it will not really make much of an impact in the overall delay calculation yes sir okay thank you uh sir what is this uh source we're talking about is it the voltage source we're providing yeah we're just saying that okay there is a voltage source

input point where we you have given a pulse there will be an output capacitance of a gate and at the uh 0.2 and 0.4 there would be some like if if this gate is driving some another gates then this point 2 and 4 will have some input capacitance of those gates yes but so we already said that c2 and c4 and ci would include the load capacitance that is what i just suggested or you can put them in parallel or you can put them in parallel okay ci to c2 c4 and ci uh as far as the capacitance the self loading of the driver is concerned you're right it comes into picture so we can put it there but because we are also considering the driver as the source uh it will not really make much of an impact in the overall delay calculation yes sir okay thank you uh sir what is this uh source we're talking about is it the voltage source we're providing yeah we're just saying that okay there is a voltage source okay"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,T3evXVYqVz4,what are these rc models you know the stem press the step response how is the the what is the difference between the step response of a lumped model and a distributed rc network you know for example if you look at propagation delay from zero to fifty percent a lumped network would use a delay of 0.69 of rc whereas in a real rc network the delay would be only 0.38 rc and the 10 to 90 delay would be much larger much pessimistic for a lumped network than for a distributed network so what does it mean it means that lambda use karna instead we would want to use something like a pi model so you see this looks like a pi or like a t model okay and what is what has been empirically observed is that uh a three stage pi model a pi 3 model or a t3 model is a very accurate representation of most of the designs okay now typically you will see that when you do not really want absolute picosecond level accuracy you can as well go to a single pi model but if you really want very high accuracy a pi 3 model is still good enough and there's much lesser simulation time than a real distributed rc network lesser simulation you tell me how do how do simulators uh work yeah i'm not sure so you studied mattresses and your mathematics courses yes all of you have even b-tech students at triple iit and m-tech students have studied mattresses am i right yes sir so you thought they were being taught for esoteric purpose no they were taught because those are actually used by simulators simulators make mattresses and for every device they have you know a row or a column associated with them and that is how simulators do matrix transformations do their calculations and so on okay because there are multiple things which are working together so all those parallel threads or all those parallel nodes are evaluated simultaneously so if you have more number of elements what happens the matrix size increases actually matrix size depends on number of nodes so yeah i think i could relate with that and that there are number of nodes are increasing so yes so as soon as you increase the total number of elements uh things would things would increase the simulation time increases okay so actually you said simulation time would decrease decrease unlike that that's the reason why simulation time would decrease with the pi model and the pi 3 would oh okay it would decrease from a distributed rc network a distributed rc network would have thousands of small small resistances and capacitances that would have in it okay okay we are lumping them into a pi model or a pi 3 model so from there the simulation time would definitely reduce significantly okay so the simulation time is more in pi 3 model right than pi model yes but it is still much lesser than a distributed network okay uh yes i'm i am not familiar with the term distributed rc network so so distributed rc networks are we just showed that in the previous slider this is the distributed so over here this is this distributed c but there is a long wire and we say that okay all these small resistances i will i will actually show all the small resistances i will not lump them okay okay that is distributed rc so what you say is that okay i had this uh wire going from here to the inverter and then it took a turn it went into a nor gate or something huh so i put a distributed rc network would say okay uh i would want to make a rc of this i would want to make a rc of this i would want to make a rc of this a separate rc of this rc of this rc of this and so on every schematic as soon as i make the layout you will see the metal would have moved from vr1 to vr2 from metal one to metal two through a vr1 so all those transitions it would you will see okay so i'll post out extraction so the first extracted file you will see there are so many resistances and so many capacitances because at every vr it is taking a break okay every vi it says no now the new wire has started so i will model it separately so new capacitance comes into picture a new resistance comes into picture every turn something happens okay so that is distributed rc and you can imagine how many uh resistance so epic simple inverter even though it does because of metal one do you realize this yeah yeah so uh how did we so like i understand how for uh in a distributed network you would have that specific delay of point three uh eight right yeah so but uh how did we write for this we simply calculated analyzed okay common characteristics propagation delay would be something which will be 0.38 rc and if you just make a lambda thing and you will see that the delay would be different that's it we just did the analysis circuit circuits of course okay so you must have done rca networks huh yeah yes yeah that's it so uh just rc network modeling with rc network offers a certain advantage because the distributed rc network has you know if you are trying to um convert it into a distributed organization that the simulation time would reduce if i have lesser lesser uh components oh i understand that what you're just talking about that is why we're talking about these models otherwise the distributed was good enough it was very accurate okay okay yes sir so this pie model and distributor see different things two different things yeah yeah yeah vr has a different resistance model for it so if you will open the drm of any any technology you will see that resistances and vrs capacitance of contacts and vias have a completely different resistance profile than wires so but they are also copper right so why yeah they are standing yellow so the thing is that uh see vr that length is not in your control is it no sir when i make a wire i can decide how long or short i have to make this fire but for a vr you have no control over this depth this is defined by the process yes sir so whenever we put a vr we say this vr has a resistance of 10 ohms let us say now if i cannot afford 10 ohms i will put two vrs what will be the effective resistance five five i make three vrs four vrs and i can reduce the overall resistance okay okay so see in a wire you can reduce the resistance by making wider wires yes but vias you can't do that therefore we ask our resistance alex and therefore because it is given separately the tool understands it as a separate wire so sir in the elmore delay slide that was basically a distributed network you were showing uh that was this one yeah so you can call it a distributed network you may not in the sense that uh if because i have not really shown all the different or i have not shown these three components separately to you have i i have lumped all of this into anarchy yes sir so this is not really a distributed not not purely distributed but yeah wherever there is a turn even a pio model you will have to model it like this that okay so but like what is the difference between the lumped and the distributed one the lumped was actually i'm not getting confused between that okay in lumped we have no resistance also no resistance and all the capacitors are simply added okay in distributed we are distributed considering all the resistance separately and all the capacitance separately and disability yes and then they come to an intermediate pi or a c model so like pi is like an intimate between the lambda and the distributed you can say yes okay okay yeah so the caught itself thanks we do not pay that much simulation time but we get almost similar accuracy yeah yeah yes got it okay so while three segment pi model as i mentioned is very accurate but typically single segment pi model is used okay so now we come to crosstalk you understand what crosstalk is you've heard about this term earlier so i have the question from the via part that you were saying uh like if we want lesser resistance we can add two or three vias but i have read in the course like the cost of fabricating a via is much more than the metals like is it feasible to have two or three vias in place of one to just reduce the resistance or is it a good thing like so uh if it is not leading to any increase in area okay we would usually want to have redundancy in vrs and contacts okay okay but if you not want to open overkill either for example if you make a pcell of a device which is let us say 10 micron wide you will see there are hundreds of contacts it will put automatically they can happen laser you need not use a pc at all for making your inverter layout then i have you i have used yeah yeah so when you made the p cell and you made a device of let's say four micron bits how many contacts would it put on the source and drain how that that you have told in tens of them yeah as many as it could put yes sir so that is an overkill so that leads to increase in gate capacitance get to source and get to drain capacity that we don't want to do but we definitely would want to say that okay every third contact i would want to keep or every second contact i would want to keep just so that i reduced the total capacitance between gate and these contacts polyamide contacts but uh i still i am able to reduce the resistance also okay okay so multiple or this redundancy of resistances and vr's is preferred this is in fact called as design for manufacturability dsm okay so there are checks there are checks that say that you could have put two contacts over here why did you put only one okay so there are such checks also but we have to be very judicious we have to be very careful cam overdo not okay so yes yeah so in this pi or t model when we have a very long wires then this may be true but when we have wires which branch too much then maybe this model will fail because there are parallel actually uh it is for global signals that we use the spy and t models small interconnects the resistances and capacitances are small enough see if the overall value of the delay is 10 pico seconds whether you are measuring uh it accurately at at 9.7 pico seconds or whether you are measuring it at 8 00 seconds two pico seconds to after some electricity in accuracy doesn't matter so if the delays that that could be impacted are within the accuracy of your simulator or your simulation setup you don't bother about making pi np models only when you have global signals where the interconnect delays and assemblies three the interconnect delay could be 30 to 70 percent of your critical path delay so for the big big delays we want to model them as pi or t okay so so we need accuracy when we are dealing with such long interventions yes when we're dealing with long interconnects we definitely need accuracy some accuracy okay so if you give me a circuit and say that okay this much amount of delay i have to meet so as a designer when i'm starting to look at all the topologies that i can use so how can i really use this kind of model because i don't know the length but at the time of uh schematic design so what you can do is okay this capacitance is of very high importance to me this delay is is is the longest delay so i would not want to add any wire delay into it so you say you can put commands in your schematic that make these make the layout of these devices as close to each other as possible so that when you start to lay them out you you remember okay this was an important consideration so that you can do and when making the layout but otherwise uh you cannot really do much so what we usually do is we simply add some parasitic capacitance on every every intermediate node we say okay this node this node is going from one inverter to another at least two phantom farad capacitance to i diagram so we just put some some value there so that our final delays are not far away from our initial targets based upon experience yeah based on the experience and technology characterization and stuff like that yes ma'am but what lumped does is it uh it models the same between two nodes but like uh that diagram you wish it was taking all those turns and curves and modeling it as one resistance and one capacitance yeah that's the backlog okay answer another thing you you mentioned uh mentioned a point about the number of contacts we had when we were modeling for a certain bridge of females and animals and uh how we should we should be careful not to do an overkill right so when we reduce the number of contacts i understand how that would reduce the capacitance between the poly and the contact but uh how will that affect the resistance exactly so uh you see contact resistance let us say is uh 10 ohms let us say and you made 10 contacts your resistance became 1 ohm now you reduce 5 of them one key got two okay but one is that like two is as low as one yes so you say okay let me have two let me have uh you know lesser contacts than all 10 objects the resistance doesn't have that much impact in terms of in terms of magnitude yeah because finally if it is a very big driver then the resistance of the global rc network is more important okay then there would be other constraints which could come because of the total current that this rc network has to drive for example if it's a very huge capacitance and you're talking of driving it every every clock cycle then you understand that okay if the current has to flow in every cycle then i have to be careful that even after some ageing and some degradation and resistances even after that my system will work fine so then you may want to put seven contacts instead of five so there are rules for that also there are rules linked to electro migration also so don't worry there are there these are slightly advanced topics we will possibly talk about these failure modes in the last lecture of this course okay okay but just so but in the last point you mentioned that um in that case if you if you're talking about huge driver so 10 so let us assume that 10 were the by default you got from that is the maximum contacts you can put yeah we said we will in a typical case and it is not a very big driver it will reduce from 10 to 5 or 10 to 4 but if this driver is operating every cycle if the activity rate of this driver is very high then electromigration rules may require me to put seven contacts instead of four or five so that even after aging things are fine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3evXVYqVz4,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3evXVYqVz4

then electromigration rules may require me to put seven contacts instead of four or five so that even after aging things are fine"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,-1cu0NsFpEM,okay so crosstalk so any so you know you're talking about different types of capacitances of capacitance between two adjacent wires capacitance between intermittent you know one wire above one wire below and so on so the capacitance that we were talking about or characterizing till now was static capacitance where we said that this is the total capacitance where lines of fields are there and there is no transition specifically happening in either a or b there is a constant flow of current through a through b this is a steady state value but in reality we will have our signals toggle that is where we will be able to give stimuli or you know test our circuits so let us say there is this wire a and there is this wire b and wire a grows from zero to one wire b at the same time wants to go from one to zero what would happen so because of capacitive coupling uh the other wire and the wire that is going upward would also want the other wire to go go upward and and and it would become a vice versa in the case of b1 so basically the effective capacitance that it will see between each other so it will kind of double yes so what happens is that when the transitions on the two wires are opposite in direction we understand that the effective capacitance that we will see is slightly higher than regular if everything was quiet it could have simply gone up at a particular pace but now since the other wire is going down it would slow it down as if the capacitance is higher so due to coupling because of coupling the the two wires will start to influence each other a is trying to go up b is trying to go down so because b is trying to go down due to this coupling capacitance this a will now also try to go down a bit so whatever rate at it was going up it will no longer be able to go up at the same rate it will go at a slower rate similarly it was trying to go down but a was going up so it would try to pull b also up and b will actually fall at a slower rate than what it was targeted to be able to so sir it is basically both the transition times of both the signals are getting packed in this way yes okay but transition time getting impacted essentially means for for a circuit designer that rc is increasing i know so r is not changing so what do we say that we say that due to miller effects capacitance is changing so uh when i say that a transition time when they say the capacitance is decreasing so i would that will lead to propagation right not the transition i'm not going to understand you said that what you said just you know what would be talking about 0 to 50 delay what is that transition delay to here okay okay so what we are essentially saying is that uh let us say uh you know b is constant and on a you are bringing about a transition okay the c effective is c ground plus c adjacent now if b is switching alongside a then what happens because a and b are both switching together they they do not they appear to be same wires so they see adjacent kind of vanishes from the picture okay but when they are going in opposite directions then just as we saw this sea addison kind of doubles up both try to slow each other down so what we are saying is that there is this miller capacitance factor which gets multiplied with c adjacent depending on how my other signals are behaving so sir when this when they are uh talking in opposite directions so first i take the effect of a and keep be constant so i take it as one effect and then vice versa that's why i'm saying twice basically i'm taking the effect of both a and b separately and then adding them together yeah okay okay okay so this mirror capacitance factor is something that you should be aware of when you route buyers when you you know lay wires next to each other so if you know that there are two signals which are bound to go in opposite directions you better space them apart so that's the adjacent reduces but if there are wires which will typically run together in parallel you can keep them close also excuse me sir yes mother so this constant vdd means that a and b are running same are running different currents now they're running different voltages but they are running same constant voltages so a is toggling or let us say b is stopping and a is constant the other one signal is toggling the other is constant oh okay good okay yes the pump suppose it's a very big socket and we someone is making me out and they don't know like do we need to am i doubted like that they don't know that they will be talking opposite only then uh which is do we every time have to know each and every manual detail of the very big circuit so that other personally you know sometimes for example if you were designing a memory then you know that at any given point of time only one word line will go up or at the output of the decoder only one of the signals will go to one the rim others will remain zero so some circuits you can predict at other places you may not be able to predict so when you are able to predict you do something when you are not able to predict you do something else for example if some signals capacitance you just want to be constant you will then shield it you will shield it from other place otherwise so typically memory can there for example there are two or three decoders that run parallel to each other so in between those decoding lines you know one set of decoding lines and the other set of decoding lines there is a shielding okay so that's all that we can do okay what is important is to realize that the static capacitance that you typically see is not really the only capacitance so this becomes yeah this becomes very important when you're making layouts for uh for analog circuits for example you're making circuits for a layout for plls or even sense amplifiers for that matter in a memory because there you want capacitance to be predictable but then if it can change simply because of its environment you could be at risk okay so okay yes sir uh sir can we say that breaking a large device into too many fingers can increase the crosstalk no they're clear no because for a large device breaking it into fingers uh then both a and b will always switch in parallel with each other okay because they're in parallel all these transistors that you've now made they are parallel with each other the gates are shorted sources are shorter drains are also shorted so this middle capacitance will not bother you at that time yes yeah priyanka so i want to like uh if one buyer is affecting another wire so like what is the use of minimum drc then like [Music] uh okay i ask you to draw two lines uh just uh about a pencil network one micron away from each other uh like when we make the layout like we said nothing like minimum the rc uh then if the minimum the rc is not said we get there on which basis that drc is uh that is what that is the experiment i'm asking you to do now do you have a pen and a paper with you yes so just draw two lines parallel to each other at a spacing of one micron one micron is the thickness of your hair can you make them or do you think they will start to touch each other i can't make it is like they will start to touch each other so how how how closest can you make them without touching each other so that is drc that is drc it is a drc is about manufacturability it is not about electrical behavior what we are talking about now is electrical behavior are you able to see this yeah yes yes sir you're gonna be breaking it into finger like uh they've just asked uh then in that case it is a kind of smart thing to do since uh my both the signals would go in same direction and the capacitance would eventually decrease yeah that is why we discussed breaking devices into fingers because it it it can help many times listen okay so you will see there is a sweet spot there you break it into too many fingers that also doesn't help because then the overall parasitics because of sidewall capacitance start to increase just do a experiment you will see okay you had a question yeah so what are the implications of this process implications of crosstalk um let us say you are running an analog signal which is small single in nature just toggling by four five millivolts 10 millivolts and over there you have this miller capacitance crosstalk coming into picture and the adjacent signal is a digital signal going from zero to vdd what would happen um that's four or five millivolts the real signal that you had will simply vanish you will only have the crosstalk related disturbance there noise there huh so one has to be very so we are digital cores but even in digital course we have implication on delays in an analog course you will see crosstalk is can kill your circuit completely rather so so basically this miller capacitance factor is saying that the greater it will be the greater the crosstalk will be right yes okay okay yes it's a measure of crosstalk effect you can say that so this miller capacitance is this being calculated through miller's theorem by breaking the stop capacitance into two capacitances between ground uh estimated like that yes okay okay so that can kind of brings us to a closure of devices now this was a very important section of the course where we talked about mass capacitors mos transistors and also interconnects so unless we know the bricks and uh you know the bricks and mortar that we have to use we will not be able to make houses anna so we have just understood the strength of different kinds of components the weaknesses of different components and now we will start to use them in our designs the first and the simplest design that we know of is an

Transcript: okay so crosstalk so any so you know you're talking about different types of capacitances of capacitance between two adjacent wires capacitance between intermittent you know one wire above one wire below and so on so the capacitance that we were talking about or characterizing till now was static capacitance where we said that this is the total capacitance where lines of fields are there and there is no transition specifically happening in either a or b there is a constant flow of current through a through b this is a steady state value but in reality we will have our signals toggle that is where we will be able to give stimuli or you know test our circuits so let us say there is this wire a and there is this wire b and wire a grows from zero to one wire b at the same time wants to go from one to zero what would happen so because of capacitive coupling uh the other wire and the wire that is going upward would also want the other wire to go go upward and and and it would become a vice versa in the case of b1 so basically the effective capacitance that it will see between each other so it will kind of double yes so what happens is that when the transitions on the two wires are opposite in direction we understand that the effective capacitance that we will see is slightly higher than regular if everything was quiet it could have simply gone up at a particular pace but now since the other wire is going down it would slow it down as if the capacitance is higher so due to coupling because of coupling the the two wires will start to influence each other a is trying to go up b is trying to go down so because b is trying to go down due to this coupling capacitance this a will now also try to go down a bit so whatever rate at it was going up it will no longer be able to go up at the same rate it will go at a slower rate similarly it was trying to go down but a was going up so it would try to pull b also up and b will actually fall at a slower rate than what it was targeted to be able to so sir it is basically both the transition times of both the signals are getting packed in this way yes okay but transition time getting impacted essentially means for for a circuit designer that rc is increasing i know so r is not changing so what do we say that we say that due to miller effects capacitance is changing so uh when i say that a transition time when they say the capacitance is decreasing so i would that will lead to propagation right not the transition i'm not going to understand you said that what you said just you know what would be talking about 0 to 50 delay what is that transition delay to here okay okay so what we are essentially saying is that uh let us say uh you know b is constant and on a you are bringing about a transition okay the c effective is c ground plus c adjacent now if b is switching alongside a then what happens because a and b are both switching together they they do not they appear to be same wires so they see adjacent kind of vanishes from the picture okay but when they are going in opposite directions then just as we saw this sea addison kind of doubles up both try to slow each other down so what we are saying is that there is this miller capacitance factor which gets multiplied with c adjacent depending on how my other signals are behaving so sir when this when they are uh talking in opposite directions so first i take the effect of a and keep be constant so i take it as one effect and then vice versa that's why i'm saying twice basically i'm taking the effect of both a and b separately and then adding them together yeah okay okay okay so this mirror capacitance factor is something that you should be aware of when you route buyers when you you know lay wires next to each other so if you know that there are two signals which are bound to go in opposite directions you better space them apart so that's the adjacent reduces but if there are wires which will typically run together in parallel you can keep them close also excuse me sir yes mother so this constant vdd means that a and b are running same are running different currents now they're running different voltages but they are running same constant voltages so a is toggling or let us say b is stopping and a is constant the other one signal is toggling the other is constant oh okay good okay yes the pump suppose it's a very big socket and we someone is making me out and they don't know like do we need to am i doubted like that they don't know that they will be talking opposite only then uh which is do we every time have to know each and every manual detail of the very big circuit so that other personally you know sometimes for example if you were designing a memory then you know that at any given point of time only one word line will go up or at the output of the decoder only one of the signals will go to one the rim others will remain zero so some circuits you can predict at other places you may not be able to predict so when you are able to predict you do something when you are not able to predict you do something else for example if some signals capacitance you just want to be constant you will then shield it you will shield it from other place otherwise so typically memory can there for example there are two or three decoders that run parallel to each other so in between those decoding lines you know one set of decoding lines and the other set of decoding lines there is a shielding okay so that's all that we can do okay what is important is to realize that the static capacitance that you typically see is not really the only capacitance so this becomes yeah this becomes very important when you're making layouts for uh for analog circuits for example you're making circuits for a layout for plls or even sense amplifiers for that matter in a memory because there you want capacitance to be predictable but then if it can change simply because of its environment you could be at risk okay so okay yes sir uh sir can we say that breaking a large device into too many fingers can increase the crosstalk no they're clear no because for a large device breaking it into fingers uh then both a and b will always switch in parallel with each other okay because they're in parallel all these transistors that you've now made they are parallel with each other the gates are shorted sources are shorter drains are also shorted so this middle capacitance will not bother you at that time yes yeah priyanka so i want to like uh if one buyer is affecting another wire so like what is the use of minimum drc then like [Music] uh okay i ask you to draw two lines uh just uh about a pencil network one micron away from each other uh like when we make the layout like we said nothing like minimum the rc uh then if the minimum the rc is not said we get there on which basis that drc is uh that is what that is the experiment i'm asking you to do now do you have a pen and a paper with you yes so just draw two lines parallel to each other at a spacing of one micron one micron is the thickness of your hair can you make them or do you think they will start to touch each other i can't make it is like they will start to touch each other so how how how closest can you make them without touching each other so that is drc that is drc it is a drc is about manufacturability it is not about electrical behavior what we are talking about now is electrical behavior are you able to see this yeah yes yes sir you're gonna be breaking it into finger like uh they've just asked uh then in that case it is a kind of smart thing to do since uh my both the signals would go in same direction and the capacitance would eventually decrease yeah that is why we discussed breaking devices into fingers because it it it can help many times listen okay so you will see there is a sweet spot there you break it into too many fingers that also doesn't help because then the overall parasitics because of sidewall capacitance start to increase just do a experiment you will see okay you had a question yeah so what are the implications of this process implications of crosstalk um let us say you are

adjacent signal is a digital signal going from zero to vdd what would happen um that's four or five millivolts the real signal that you had will simply vanish you will only have the crosstalk related disturbance there noise there huh so one has to be very so we are digital cores but even in digital course we have implication on delays in an analog course you will see crosstalk is can kill your circuit completely rather so so basically this miller capacitance factor is saying that the greater it will be the greater the crosstalk will be right yes okay okay yes it's a measure of crosstalk effect you can say that so this miller capacitance is this being calculated through miller's theorem by breaking the stop capacitance into two capacitances between ground uh estimated like that yes okay okay so that can kind of brings us to a closure of devices now this was a very important section of the course where we talked about mass capacitors mos transistors and also interconnects so unless we know the bricks and uh you know the bricks and mortar that we have to use we will not be able to make houses anna so we have just understood the strength of different kinds of components the weaknesses of different components and now we will start to use them in our designs the first and the simplest design that we know of is an inverter all of you know what an inverter is what is an inverter"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,hM594Hm2zcA,so you give an input one it gives an output zero you give an input zero it gives an output one something like this huh if so this is the bjt inverter this must be this many people would have studied in their earliest uh electronics course because bjts were are the brilliant butter of first year courses few places bjts are not even talked about people only talk about cmos only but yeah this is one one of the oldest implementation of an inverter when cmos did not exist only bjts existed so what we said was that if you increase vi what happens the current that can flow through this bjt increases and therefore v out goes to zero and this is the transfer characteristic what does it mean how how will a vi a change in vi transfer to a change in v out that's why it's called transfer characteristic clearly you cannot get a very clean 0 over here because there is some resistance of this bjt that will come into picture and also there is a continuous flow of current are you able to see this yes so not really the best way to design an inverter especially in today's technologies so we come to mos inverters let us say this is something we do so over here again you will notice that there is a continuous flow of current that will happen when the output is intended to be kept at 0. when v out is expected to be 0 then there is a continuous flow of current that will happen from vs so we move to what is called as c mass what is the beauty of cmos that when the input is 0 the pmos is on and the inverse is off so what happens once you charge the output capacitance no further current would flow you know this all of you any mirror you have a question so from our previous courses what we did was that we used to bias our bjt to a particular voltage and then at a particular bias point and then we used to give it small signal voltage as an input that's a small similar to lasting analysis then however today we'd lastly talk about small signal analysis and bjts because we know that would be similar okay in fact today we talk of even small signal on cmos only bjts are avoided because they simply have a lot of gate current and other inefficiencies in there uh but uh yeah that is probably the only place that bjts are used for analog circuits where small signals have to be handled very carefully you need lots of gain and everything you can't do without a bjt then answer what uh what were the disadvantages we were facing uh like in the previous slide when we use mosfet technology for example so yeah what were the problems we were facing responsibilities i put a one over here so what happens uh this device is fully on it will sync current and this will continue to provide current so there's a short circuit path so when the output is intended to be zero there's a short circuit path so again when the pmos was not being able to be manufactured this was still better than bjt but now that we also have pmosses we only use cmos okay and this this part one on the right you already know very well isn't it we've discussed this in detail what is this the layout layout of an inverter and there could be another layout of the inverter where so if you want to connect two layouts to inverters uh you simply abut them you know so we discussed abutment you simply about them and the output of one you short to the input of the other and bingo you have the output there in fact b already exists you only need to make this connection and your two inverters are connected into a buffer vdd and ground already shared because they get connected like this they're able to relate this we've already discussed this in the class in the class also office hours also multiple times and this is the inverter with a strap where we say that okay i will also have a strap within the standard cell and we already agreed that this is no longer a good idea because you see this this kind of height is wasted so we said that no we will not do that we will in fact have it like this only where the straps will be added later you remember this uh sir in this in this on lisa how is this what is the strap part here in this this part yeah okay so this is the n mass but you notice they have a n plus over here instead of p plus yeah yeah yes so this becomes the strap connection yes so what would happen in uh normal standard cell would be that if metal would be running over the ground and at some place along the line the staff would be placed and it would not occupy a specific area like it is occupying here into that correct so for example if i have to put a strap i will simply add a strap cell here and over here there will be what do you say the substrate connection for the pmos substrate inverse substrate connection for the pivot and the vdd on ground will go ahead like this and then you will have another cell that would you could put over here and so on so um did i did i answer you or did i answer something else completely uh sir okay i got i got it i got my bike yes okay sir i have a question once instead yes sir here you have drawn od uh the yellow one and green one so in that od you have made a l type of cut so so this l type of cuts and would this be feasible in that technology that yes yeah yeah you can't do that we would want you to avoid it in advanced technologies we would want you to avoid it but in earlier technologies just to reduce the source and drain capacitance source and drain leakage basically reducing the source drain area we would do that no it's no challenges we can't do that in 65 you can't do that okay enter in 18 you will not be allowed to do this sir in the next slide that you show this trap so there there you are drawing a np layer and pp they're very very small yes but sir it has a minimum drc of minimum area so can we draw it inside like that very very small no so this is this is for a still older technology you may say this is a one micron technology you see lam or this is 0.6 micron technology i know this is very old technology in those technologies it was possible that was the way it was designed okay the way i said hello when do we use these two those two inverters two inverters yeah buffer to make a buffer yeah yeah back the two inverters right one after the other so that we have a buffer and reducing the so the substrate resistance yeah so the straps are providing the vdd and ground connections to the substrates okay um so this is for substrate connections straps are substrate connections it was in middle previously i'm sorry that that police silicon was in middle and the red car in the previous market now it moves to left side is there any specific reason no no no specific reason this is the kind of layout you will use today this is just how it was used to it it could have been done and was used was probably done earlier today you will see that uh poly will only be vertical you will not be even allowed to route poly in two directions so that this is the layout you will end up using anyway earlier okay people thought that okay you know i will simply make i i don't even need to make an extra virus you see the out is going out till here and the n is also connected by material to here you just above them and they get connected so that was the intent at some point of time but not really needed moreover they wanted to make buttered straps so source kasathi they just butted the strap region uh today straps are not handled like this at all so it's it's really not a challenge okay tyler uh on the inverter when we were drawing a single inverter i think you were explaining the circuit of the inverter with p was inverse so can you please explain the circuit so a bit of pmos and nmos yes sir you're talking about response time or something like that uh yes sir so you were explaining the capacitor will charge and then someone asks doubt don't worry you will not miss anything yeah this circuit huh i think you were actually saying that when the input is zero the pmos is on nmos is off yes so the capacitor will charge and that's it no further current i know whereas in bjt and mosfet the most mass inverters there were there was a continuous flow of current yes so that is the beauty of cmos okay so so that's it current goes only during the transition transient period after that and before that current is zero whereas in bjts and other places the current will flow for uh continuously is when your input is let us say one or zero whatever okay okay thank you yeah uh rajneesh you have a question uh yes sir sir in the previous lecture uh sir when uh i was doing some uh the custom layout in that when over the od when i was doing this making the source and the trend then sir this non-buttered error was coming drc so sir i was not able to figure out that what was the mistake in that drc was coming that it is non-butted so i was not able to clear itself non-buttered drc was coming yes sir it was written did you did you strap did you put the proper straps on your circuit and everything yes sir but yes sir your scraps are put in yes so i don't know what exactly this would mean so just check the language and uh okay so okay i'll figure it out yeah okay okay yeah so now we come to the dc response what do you mean by dc response so i mean we give input as a dc signal and we see this response by the circuit yeah in the dc domain itself if my input is held constant at a particular voltage level at what voltage my output would be held at that is my dc response i'm not talking about transitioning from 0 to 1 i'm talking about if my input is at say 200 millivolts where will my output be for example we are saying when vn is equal to zero the output uh when v is equal to zero or v equal to vdd the output will be vdd or output will be zero that is dc huh and in between these it depends on the transistor size and current such that the current from the nmos and pmos is balanced are you with me over here in dc current any capacitance or anything else doesn't even come into picture because talking about all transient being taken care of and now where does the value stabilize so what do you mean by the balancing of this uh ids these uh pmos current inverse current you tell me there is this node what is the kirchhoff's current law according to this node incoming what does scripture of current law say some incoming is close to outgoing yeah so where all the current could be coming in here and going up from here only these two nmos and p master yeah yes sir so we are saying that kirchhoff's current law cannot be violated okay okay that is all nothing else okay so uh let us look at this this much you know you know what is the cutoff region uh what is the linear region for the nmos what is the saturated region for the nmos and the pmos also so pmos is simply the duel of this you remember this much yes sir huh so uh yeah the bms is simply the dual of that and mos volatility if they try to make the current curves i ids curves uh ids vds curves for different various values this is something what you would get provided that you are saying that beta n is equal to beta p so vg vgs p5 will be equal to or the current at vdsp5 and magnitude will be equal to current at vgsn5 is this okay so beta factor is here beta factor is that over here we are saying that current at a particular vds has been equalized by changing the width by making the pmos wider there is a ratio of mobility the pmos has lower mobility the the holes in the pmos the carriers in the pmos have lower mobility than the carriers in the nmos so that you compensate by making the pmus wider so that overall beta that comes in the current equation is equal this beta is k and c x yeah and also includes w and l into it so actually i'm not able to get what exactly we know beta here like u so this current what is the current equation yeah w and w by l and then vgs minus vp the whole square something all this is being put as beta okay okay fine again okay so we're simply saying that you size the p mass up in such a way that k so this is what this is how your ids vds curves would look like yes sir huh so if we now plot them for a circuit per say what would happen we said ids and id ids n and idst should be equal that is where i will get to know where my device is in different positions am i right that is what we said so i would essentially need to plot ids n and absolute value of ids p1 over the other to get something like this are you with me huh the y axis is uh it's a ratio like there are two different values like comma it's a comma comma comma okay okay we already said that beta n is equal to beta p you're just going forward from there okay okay so what happens now we start to say that for a given ids n and idsp what will be the value of v out can we make that thing out so v out is all those points where the current values are equal can we say this hello listen so how does this become this appear then so the first point is let us say uh so where are the values see there is one intersection happening here are you able to see that then there is another intersection happening here another happening here and so on so if we start to plot it like this then this is the way our inter intersections would play out at different values of v in see what am i doing i'm changing the value of v in at different values of v in different curves would come into picture there is this curve for the n mass and this curve for the p mass huh so where do they intersect at a value of v in they intersect at almost vdd so v out will be almost vdd when we are when vn is equal to 0.2 when v in goes to 0.4 these are the two curves that come into picture and my v out will be almost equal to vdd though not equal to vdd slightly lesser than vdd there you go to vn equal to 0.6 and you see array the intersection point now has come to almost zero to go to point eight it is act zero so now when you plot when now when you plot it you see that okay v in zero v in one v in two mean three v in four v in five and you get what you call as the transfer characteristic of your inverter are you able to see this any questions so what will happen at vdd by 2 like when we have it is not zero or vtd yeah so our vdd by two we would probably have had this point yes sir so what's with the output when v is is that for different bean values we plotted the ids curve for the pmos and mass and then the intersection points is the second graph right the red one yes we plotted the intersection points over here and then we started i can simply plot them over here that is my v out yeah yeah i got it sir that is how you make the transfer characteristics yeah and the intersection point was coming because of the kids of lawn mitsubi because of intersection of being one for uh p mos and v in one for the n mass yeah the current has to be equal right yes currents have to be kcl yeah yes goddess thank you so uh yes so in the left graph what were we plotting on x axis and y x now on y axis particularly on the left side graph this is current na ids in an [Music] vn is equal to vds value see this this characteristic that you see is for different values of vts is it not yes sir but for any mean value there will only be one of these lines valid yes so for any v in value there is just one of these lines which is valid that is what we are showing okay huh so now at different points abcdef abcde where are my different transistors so at a my nmos is in cut off cmos is in linear and you can actually put this fill this entire table like this can you verify this table is filled correctly any questions any confusion around it sure uh i have a confusion in region b and d and the region b and d where we are say uh saying that region b and d yes sir so do we want to go back to the curves once again and see yes sir so region b is when your v in is uh between vdd by two and uh vtn so let us say it is point four vdd is it okay point four curve decay so you see what is happening my n mass isn't clearly in saturation what about my p mass isn't linear okay anna sir one more oh okay okay understood sir oh i had one more question also that looking at the point in the graph we can also predict the amount of current that could be flowing right yeah or the distance was not the ideal value vertical axis that is the amount of current that is flowing okay yes so what is the amount of current that is flowing now tell me certain b and d the current uh through the nmos would be very low so when the input is at vdd by two when the input is rpd by two okay so this is your current pump so there is no current when the input was zero or when the input was one only when the transition was happening there was some current yes okay thank you sir sir in this current one so when we had in the points b and b then basically the pmos and or either of the female 7 was in linear right so the current so i mean if except for when both are in cut off then some current would be flowing so i am not able to understand this curve actually so let us look at it over here quran so at different at this value then my let us say this is point a v n is equal to 0.2 is point a what is the value of current it's almost zero yeah i go to point b what is the value of current now okay right okay this is the value now it is not zero it is more than zero now if i had a bean is equal to 0.5 you will see that uh it would be somewhere here the point of intersection would have been somewhere here but both yes see this is very important uh those of you who are mtext students you probably already realize that you never got to see an inverter like this ever earlier did you yes sir huh so almost nowhere you will see inverter being taught in such detail and with such uh you know uh cut off the saturation but this is very important for you to understand even though we are talking about digital circuits uh if you do not understand where your device is operating in for example you will not know how to make a capacitance capacitance so these concepts are really important they will really help you become good circuit designers so is cheesecake rma please be very comfortable with it i can give you uh another circuit and ask you keep onsite device saturation may have and and stuff like that typically interviews so good designers when they interview you you will they will typically end up asking you the transfer characteristics of an inverter somewhere in one question or another okay so please be very well versed with this idea so we have covered two critical concepts please practice and this concept also i'm saying that we have covered it in class we are covering it i am trying to resolve all your queries but even if you get queries again at home you can read the book you can review the lecture again but please be very clear about this concept yes there was a question yes sir so so when both the devices like nmos and pmos are in saturation i am seeing that i have the max amount of current so that means that this will be the point that will be associated with the maximum power dissipation kind of the most powerful right so like but what exactly is the utility of this region i mean i'm getting it but uh is it like because so this power is static power or the dynamic power for example this power what will how would i we're talking about dc analysis so there's nothing dynamic can yet yet okay so it's static power only if you will bias your inverter at this point it will consume the maximum current but do you realize it is also the most sensitive a small change in invert input one millivolt here or one millivolt there the output will change swing by 100 millivolts yeah yes sir that's the importance of this point okay so like uh for example like generally sena key the cmos uh inverter has zero static power dissipation it has only dynamic thing but from here i can see that no there is some dissipation because we are over here talking about using an inverter as an amplifier you see that is what i'm saying if you put a small signal at c what happens output would travel from uh you just toggle the input from plus minus three millivolts output will toggle by plus minus three hundred millivolts yeah it's amplifying 100 times so when you want to use the inverter as an amplifier then amplifier will consume current but otherwise if you want to use it as a digital logic then you don't need to worry about the c point c point will just come and go like this it's so fast okay so so like for me the v in for example if i have to do for the digital circuit so the v in will be the basically the biasing voltage which is circuit vn will simply come come from zero and go to vdd and let us say hundred picoseconds so within hundred picoseconds this abcde would have already moved okay so but still this current this curve will get now right so the area will come and go to the combination so you can possibly plot it with time you can do it like this so uh i say that uh sna so what i a typical question that i ask in interviews i would ask in interviews would be that these are a b c d e this is my input and this is time access okay i would ask people to plot the current waveform with respect to time what would you do the plot would actually come like this only yeah this is just a different way of putting the question now you notice that if i improve the input slope what happens then this area would be much lesser yes okay right this value remains same but the charge that i consume that i waste reduces significantly that is where when we will talk about power later in this course we will talk about using good rise time and fall time yeah so so the the y axis basically would be remain the same but the x axis the time and the bits would decrease yeah yeah if you have good rise time and fall time you can reduce overall charge consumed in this transition because you have reduced the pulse width for this current curve yeah yes sir okay yes got it sir so this is something we will anyways cover later but concept should augment clarify career the concept should be clear for everyone now mother you have a question yes sir so why were we talking about biasing in this circuit when we are making a digital inverter no because if we want to make an amplifier out of an inverter then we want to talk about biasing also yes and what is an inverter it can operate like anything okay so so when we are making use of this inverter as a common source amplifier then we are talking about biasing not just a common source is simply saying huh an amplifier okay and in digital we won't pay much attention to this c region we will just go from a to e directly so if your input slope is bad as in the top timing curve yes sir then the c region also becomes very important because that c region would also exist for a long time it will define the total current consumption now yes sir so if your input is rising very very slowly or falling very very slowly then the c region also is there for a long time then this kind of becomes time access so the charge that you consume that is transferred from vdg to ground that is wasted increases and our power increases so c region doesn't seem to be appearing for a very long time it is just a if this is my curve time this is if this is my input waveform with respect to time then the c region is going to be there for a longer time now in comparison to here yes yes yeah that is what i'm talking about okay okay yes yes yes can we also uh change this uh width of this current loop by changing changing the width of the mosfets yes obviously because as soon as you change the width of the mosfets uh ids and vds would change the whole you know ideas and vds are dependent on width is dependent on width of the device yes so sir i have confusion in this thing only that let's say that i want this to be a very very fast transition uh inverter so ico can increase uh pretty much by some amount and i increase the inverse width by something so basically after increasing the width of the pmos and mass although this uh transition is very very fast but but the current has also increased so basically i i will now have more current through my mosfets this is the input transition not the output transition there is some other inverter driving v in now to get a good slope on vn you have to increase the size of this inverter talking about the rise and fall time of the input of the input now so that input riser falls [Music] [Laughter] there is a logical effort velocity will come to that and probably the next class,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM594Hm2zcA,"Link:

have studied in their earliest uh electronics course because bjts were are the brilliant butter of first year courses few places bjts are not even talked about people only talk about cmos only but yeah this is one one of the oldest implementation of an inverter when cmos did not exist only bjts existed so what we said was that if you increase vi what happens the current that can flow through this bjt increases and therefore v out goes to zero and this is the transfer characteristic what does it mean how how will a vi a change in vi transfer to a change in v out that's why it's called transfer characteristic clearly you cannot get a very clean 0 over here because there is some resistance of this bjt that will come into picture and also there is a continuous flow of current are you able to see this yes so not really the best way to design an inverter especially in today's technologies so we come to mos inverters let us say this is something we do so over here again you will notice that there is a continuous flow of current that will happen when the output is intended to be kept at 0. when v out is expected to be 0 then there is a continuous flow of current that will happen from vs so we move to what is called as c mass what is the beauty of cmos that when the input is 0 the pmos is on and the inverse is off so what happens once you charge the output capacitance no further current would flow you know this all of you any mirror you have a question so from our previous courses what we did was that we used to bias our bjt to a particular voltage and then at a particular bias point and then we used to give it small signal voltage as an input that's a small similar to lasting analysis then however today we'd lastly talk about small signal analysis and bjts because we know that would be similar okay in fact today we talk of even small signal on cmos only bjts are avoided because they simply have a lot of gate current and other inefficiencies in there uh but uh yeah that is probably the only place that bjts are used for analog circuits where small signals have to be handled very carefully you need lots of gain and everything you can't do without a bjt then answer what uh what were the disadvantages we were facing uh like in the previous slide when we use mosfet technology for example so yeah what were the problems we were facing responsibilities i put a one over here so what happens uh this device is fully on it will sync current and this will continue to provide current so there's a short circuit path so when the output is intended to be zero there's a short circuit path so again when the pmos was not being able to be manufactured this was still better than bjt but now that we also have pmosses we only use cmos okay and this this part one on the right you already know very well isn't it we've discussed this in detail what is this the layout layout of an inverter and there could be another layout of the inverter where so if you want to connect two layouts to inverters uh you simply abut them you know so we discussed abutment you simply about them and the output of one you short to the input of the other and bingo you have the output there in fact b already exists you only need to make this connection and your two inverters are connected into a buffer vdd and ground already shared because they get connected like this they're able to relate this we've already discussed this in the class in the class also office hours also multiple times and this is the inverter with a strap where we say that okay i will also have a strap within the standard cell and we already agreed that this is no longer a good idea because you see this this kind of height is wasted so we said that no we will not do that we will in fact have it like this only where the straps will be added later you remember this uh sir in this in this on lisa how is this what is the strap part here in this this part yeah okay so this is the n mass but you notice they have a n plus over here instead of p plus yeah yeah yes so this becomes the strap connection yes so what would happen in uh normal standard cell would be that if metal would be running over the ground and at some place along the line the staff would be placed and it would not occupy a specific area like it is occupying here into that correct so for example if i have to put a strap i will simply add a strap cell here and over here there will be what do you say the substrate connection for the pmos substrate inverse substrate connection for the pivot and the vdd on ground will go ahead like this and then you will have another cell that would you could put over here and so on so um did i did i answer you or did i answer something else completely uh sir okay i got i got it i got my bike yes okay sir i have a question once instead yes sir here you have drawn od uh the yellow one and green one so in that od you have made a l type of cut so so this l type of cuts and would this be feasible in that technology that yes yeah yeah you can't do that we would want you to avoid it in advanced technologies we would want you to avoid it but in earlier technologies just to reduce the source and drain capacitance source and drain leakage basically reducing the source drain area we would do that no it's no challenges we can't do that in 65 you can't do that okay enter in 18 you will not be allowed to do this sir in the next slide that you show this trap so there there you are drawing a np layer and pp they're very very small yes but sir it has a minimum drc of minimum area so can we draw it inside like that very very small no so this is this is for a still older technology you may say this is a one micron technology you see lam or this is 0.6 micron technology i know this is very old technology in those technologies it was possible that was the way it was designed okay the way i said hello when do we use these two those two inverters two inverters yeah buffer to make a buffer yeah yeah back the two inverters right one after the other so that we have a buffer and reducing the so the substrate resistance yeah so the straps are providing the vdd and ground connections to the substrates okay um so this is for substrate connections straps are substrate connections it was in middle previously i'm sorry that that police silicon was in middle and the red car in the previous market now it moves to left side is there any specific reason no no no specific reason this is the kind of layout you will use today this is just how it was used to it it could have been done and was used was probably done earlier today you will see that uh poly will only be vertical you will not be even allowed to route poly in two directions so that this is the layout you will end up using anyway earlier okay people thought that okay you know i will simply make i i don't even need to make an extra virus you see the out is going out till here and the n is also connected by material to here you just above them and they get connected so that was the intent at some point of time but not really needed moreover they wanted to make buttered straps so source kasathi they just butted the strap region uh today straps are not handled like this at all so it's it's really not a challenge okay tyler uh on the inverter when we were drawing a single inverter i think you were explaining the circuit of the inverter with p was inverse so can you please explain the circuit so a bit of pmos and nmos yes sir you're talking about response time or something like that uh yes sir so you were explaining the capacitor will charge and then someone asks doubt don't worry you will not miss anything yeah this circuit huh i think you were actually saying that when the input is zero the pmos is on nmos is off yes so the capacitor will charge and that's it no further current i know whereas in bjt and mosfet the most mass inverters there were there was a continuous flow of current yes so that is the beauty of cmos okay so so that's it current goes only during the transition transient period after that and before that current is zero whereas in bjts and other places the current will flow for uh continuously is when your input is let us say one or zero whatever okay okay thank you yeah uh rajneesh you have a question uh yes sir sir in the previous lecture uh sir when uh i was doing some uh the custom layout in that when over the od when i was doing this making the source and the trend then sir this non-buttered error was coming drc so sir i was not able to figure out that what was the mistake in that drc was coming that it is non-butted so i was not able to clear itself non-buttered drc was coming yes sir it was written did you did you strap did you put the proper straps on your circuit and everything yes sir but yes sir your scraps are put in yes so i don't know what exactly this would mean so just check the language and uh okay so okay i'll figure it out yeah okay okay yeah so now we come to the dc response what do you mean by dc response so i mean we give input as a dc signal and we see this response by the circuit yeah in the dc domain itself if my input is held constant at a particular voltage level at what voltage my output would be held at that is my dc response i'm not talking about transitioning from 0 to 1 i'm talking about if my input is at say 200 millivolts where will my output be for example we are saying when vn is equal to zero the output uh when v is equal to zero or v equal to vdd the output will be vdd or output will be zero that is dc huh and in between these it depends on the transistor size and current such that the current from the nmos and pmos is balanced are you with me over here in dc current any capacitance or anything else doesn't even come into picture because talking about all transient being taken care of and now where does the value stabilize so what do you mean by the balancing of this uh ids these uh pmos current inverse current you tell me there is this node what is the kirchhoff's current law according to this node incoming what does scripture of current law say some incoming is close to outgoing yeah so where all the current could be coming in here and going up from here only these two nmos and p master yeah yes sir so we are saying that kirchhoff's current law cannot be violated okay okay that is all nothing else okay so uh let us look at this this much you know you know what is the cutoff region uh what is the linear region for the nmos what is the saturated region for the nmos and the pmos also so pmos is simply the duel of this you remember this much yes sir huh so uh yeah the bms is simply the dual of that and mos volatility if they try to make the current curves i ids curves uh ids vds curves for different various values this is something what you would get provided that you are saying that beta n is equal to beta p so vg vgs p5 will be equal to or the current at vdsp5 and magnitude will be equal to current at vgsn5 is this okay so beta factor is here beta factor is that over here we are saying that current at a particular vds has been equalized by changing the width by making the pmos wider there is a ratio of mobility the pmos has lower mobility the the holes in the pmos the carriers in the pmos have lower mobility than the carriers in the nmos so that you compensate by making the pmus wider so that overall beta that comes in the current equation is equal this beta is k and c x yeah and also includes w and l into it so actually i'm not able to get what exactly we know beta here like u so this current what is the current equation yeah w and w by l and then vgs minus vp the whole square something all this is being put as beta okay okay fine again okay so we're simply saying that you size the p mass up in such a way that k so this is what this is how your ids vds curves would look like yes sir huh so if we now plot them for a circuit per say what would happen we said ids and id ids n and idst should be equal that is where i will get to know where my device is in different positions am i right that is what we said so i would essentially need to plot ids n and absolute value of ids p1 over the other to get something like this are you with me huh the y axis is uh it's a ratio like there are two different values like comma it's a comma comma comma okay okay we already said that beta n is equal to beta p you're just going forward from there okay okay so what happens now we start to say that for a given ids n and idsp what will be the value of v out can we make that thing out so v out is all those points where the current values are equal can we say this hello listen so how does this become this appear then so the first point is let us say uh so where are the values see there is one intersection happening here are you able to see that then there is another intersection happening here another happening here and so on so if we start to plot it like this then this is the way our inter intersections would play out at different values of v in see what am i doing i'm changing the value of v in at different values of v in different curves would come into picture there is this curve for the n mass and this curve for the p mass huh so where do they intersect at a value of v in they intersect at almost vdd so v out will be almost vdd when we are when vn is equal to 0.2 when v in goes to 0.4 these are the two curves that come into picture and my v out will be almost equal to vdd though not equal to vdd slightly lesser than vdd there you go to vn equal to 0.6 and you see array the intersection point now has come to almost zero to go to point eight it is act zero so now when you plot when now when you plot it you see that okay v in zero v in one v in two mean three v in four v in five and you get what you call as the transfer characteristic of your inverter are you able to see this any questions so what will happen at vdd by 2 like when we have it is not zero or vtd yeah so our vdd by two we would probably have had this point yes sir so what's with the output when v is is that for different bean values we plotted the ids curve for the pmos and mass and then the intersection points is the second graph right the red one yes we plotted the intersection points over here and then we started i can simply plot them over here that is my v out yeah yeah i got it sir that is how you make the transfer characteristics yeah and the intersection point was coming because of the kids of lawn mitsubi because of intersection of being one for uh p mos and v in one for the n mass yeah the current has to be equal right yes currents have to be kcl yeah yes goddess thank you so uh yes so in the left graph what were we plotting on x axis and y x now on y axis particularly on the left side graph this is current na ids in an [Music] vn is equal to vds value see this this characteristic that you see is for different values of vts is it not yes sir but for any mean value there will only be one of these lines valid yes so for any v in value there is just one of these lines which is valid that is what we are showing okay huh so now at different points abcdef abcde where are my different transistors so at a my nmos is in cut off cmos is in linear and you can actually put this fill this entire table like this can you verify this table is filled correctly any questions any confusion around it sure uh i have a confusion in region b and d and the region b and d where we are say uh saying that region b and d yes sir so do we want to go back to the curves once again and see yes sir so region b is when your v in is uh between vdd by two and uh vtn so let us say it is point four vdd is it okay point four curve decay so you see what is happening my n mass isn't clearly in saturation what about my p mass isn't linear okay anna sir one more oh okay okay understood sir oh i had one more question also that looking at the point in the graph we can also predict the amount of current that could be flowing right yeah or the distance was not the ideal value vertical axis that is the amount of current that is flowing okay yes so what is the amount of current that is flowing now tell me certain b and d the current uh through the nmos would be very low so when the input is at vdd by two when the input is rpd by two okay so this is your current pump so there is no current when the input was zero or when the input was one only when the transition was happening there was some current yes okay thank you sir sir in this current one so when we had in the points b and b then basically the pmos and or either of the female 7 was in linear right so the current so i mean if except for when both are in cut off then some current would be flowing so i am not able to understand this curve actually so let us look at it over here quran so at different at this value then my let us say this is point a v n is equal to 0.2 is point a what is the value of current it's almost zero yeah i go to point b what is the value of current now okay right okay this is the value now it is not zero it is more than zero now if i had a bean is equal to 0.5 you will see that uh it would be somewhere here the point of intersection would have been somewhere here but both yes see this is very important uh those of you who are mtext students you probably already realize that you never got to see an inverter like this ever earlier did you yes sir huh so almost nowhere you will see inverter being taught in such detail and with such uh you know uh cut off the saturation but this is very important for you to understand even though we are talking about digital circuits uh if you do not understand where your device is operating in for example you will not know how to make a capacitance capacitance so these concepts are really important they will really help you become good circuit designers so is cheesecake rma please be very comfortable with it i can give you uh another circuit and ask you keep onsite device saturation may have and and stuff like that typically interviews so good designers when they interview you you will they will typically end up asking you the transfer characteristics of an inverter somewhere in one question or another okay so please be very well versed with this idea so we have covered two critical concepts please practice and this concept also i'm saying that we have covered it in class we are covering it i am trying to resolve all your queries but even if you get queries again at home you can read the book you can review the lecture again but please be very clear about this concept yes there was a question yes sir so so when both the devices like nmos and pmos are in saturation i am seeing that i have the max amount of current so that means that this will be the point that will be associated with the maximum power dissipation kind of the most powerful right so like but what exactly is the utility of this region i mean i'm getting it but uh is it like because so this power is static power or the dynamic power for example this power what will how would i we're talking about dc analysis so there's nothing dynamic can yet yet okay so it's static power only if you will bias your inverter at this point it will consume the maximum current but do you realize it is also the most sensitive a small change in invert input one millivolt here or one millivolt there the output will change swing by 100 millivolts yeah yes sir that's the importance of this point okay so like uh for example like generally sena key the cmos uh inverter has zero static power dissipation it has only dynamic thing but from here i can see that no there is some dissipation because we are over here talking about using an inverter as an amplifier you see that is what i'm saying if you put a small signal at c what happens output would travel from uh you just toggle the input from plus minus three millivolts output will toggle by plus minus three hundred millivolts yeah it's amplifying 100 times so when you want to use the inverter as an amplifier then amplifier will consume current but otherwise if you want to use it as a digital logic then you don't need to worry about the c point c point will just come and go like this it's so fast okay so so like for me the v in for example if i have to do for the digital circuit so the v in will be the basically the biasing voltage which is circuit vn will simply come come from zero and go to vdd and let us say hundred picoseconds so within hundred picoseconds this abcde would have already moved okay so but still this current this curve will get now right so the area will come and go to the combination so you can possibly plot it with time you can do it like this so uh i say that uh sna so what i a typical question that i ask in interviews i would ask in interviews would be that these are a b c d e this is my input and this is time access okay i would ask people to plot the current waveform with respect to time what would you do the plot would actually come like this only yeah this is just a different way of putting the question now you notice that if i improve the input slope what happens then this area would be much lesser yes okay right this value remains same but the charge that i consume that i waste reduces significantly that is where when we will talk about power later in this course we will talk about using good rise time and fall time yeah so so the the y axis basically would be remain the same but the x axis the time and the bits would decrease yeah yeah if you have good rise time and fall time you can reduce overall charge consumed in this transition because you have reduced the pulse width for this current curve yeah yes sir okay yes got it sir so this is something we will anyways cover later but concept should augment clarify career the concept should be clear for everyone now mother you have a question yes sir so why were we talking about biasing in this circuit when we are making a digital inverter no because if we want to make an amplifier out of an inverter then we want to talk about biasing also yes and what is an inverter it can operate like anything okay so so when we are making use of this inverter as a common source amplifier then we are talking about biasing not just a common source is simply saying huh an amplifier okay and in digital we won't pay much attention to this c region we will just go from a to e directly so if your input slope is bad as in the top timing curve yes sir then the c region also becomes very important because that c region would also exist for a long time it will define the total current consumption now yes sir so if your input is rising very very slowly or falling very very slowly then the c region also is there for a long time then this kind of becomes time access so the charge that you consume that is transferred from vdg to ground that is wasted increases and our power increases so c region doesn't seem to be appearing for a very long time it is just a if this is my curve time this is if this is my input waveform with respect to time then the c region is going to be there for a longer time now in comparison to here yes yes yeah that is what i'm talking about okay okay yes yes yes can we also uh change this uh width of this current loop by changing changing the width of the mosfets yes obviously because as soon as you change the width of the mosfets uh ids and vds would change the whole you know ideas and vds are dependent on width is dependent on width of the device yes so sir i have confusion in this thing only that let's say that i want this to be a very very fast transition uh inverter so ico can increase uh pretty much by some amount and i increase the inverse width by something so basically after increasing the width of the pmos and mass although this uh transition is very very fast but but the current has also increased so basically i i will now have more current through my mosfets this is the input transition not the output transition there is some other inverter driving v in now to get a good slope on vn you have to increase the size of this inverter talking about the rise and fall time of the input of the input now so that input riser falls [Music] [Laughter] there is a logical effort velocity will come to that and probably the next class"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,L69CwjaRr2g,what were we discussing in the last class it's a dc transfer characteristics dc transfer characteristics often of a cmos inverter okay what does this mean for different values of v in what will be the v out and the input is stable and the output is expected to be stable am i right yes this is something like a bias current simulation see what is the what will be the current flowing what will be the uh what will be the state of my system if my vn is at some particular level okay and we saw that at different values of vn my system uh you know some devices were in cutoff or linear or saturation and so on due to which i had a certain certain kind of a current waveform arising out of it you remember that we said that in this thing the current will be like very high over here and then at e again it will be zero you remember this yes and we also said that while this is a v in over v out kind of a curve you could also have it as a uh v out over uh timing kind of a curve you remember that that i could actually say that my v in is moving like this so this is point a this is point b this is point c this is point d and this is point e so what happens the current at a is is plotted here current at b is plotted here current at c is plotted here current at d is plotted here and then current at e is spotted here and i can get actually the timing waveform for the current also from this curve itself if i have the timing waveform of the input are you able to see this we discussed this part also yes and we also discussed that that this is one reason why we want the ice time and fall times to be sharp to be steep so that we have lesser current flowing through the system or the lesser duration for which this very high current would flow you remember this yes sir now so let us keep this learning uh with us we will pick it up in just a little while when we talk about transient analysis but we will not talk about the same thing again we will talk about other aspects of transient analysis but this is something which you should be able to do for transient analysis also okay now tell me one thing in this curve if we had assumed that beta n is equal to beta p you remember yes sir and that is why the c or this this inflection point was coming at almost like vdd by 2. now what would happen if i change if i make beta n stronger than beta p it will fall down faster it will fall down faster so this is not a time now this is v out by v so what happens to this curve i think it will shift it will shift towards left not with what happens if i make beta p is greater than much greater than beta n right right yeah so uh such curves you know such transistors which we have such inverters or such gates where we have uh beta n not equal to beta p you would notice that the the infection point will be on either side of vdd by two okay these are called skewed gates there is importance there is a relevance for these gates we will look at that a little later in the course but i just want you to keep that in your mind you know park it for yourself that this is how uh like this this characteristic that we just did can be used to represent skewed gates also and this vowed by v incur can be used to actually represent any other gate also just that because of different beta ratio your curve could be over here or over here so are you able to see this yes sir yes so what do you mean by the other gates and this like nand gate nor gate xor gate five input nand gate two input nand gate three input nand gate all the various range of gates that you may want to use in your designs later so both of the all these gates will have these kind of characteristics only yeah all these girls will have v out by v in characteristic is it not same okay the trend would be the same not same because beta ratio will be different they will have slightly different but the trend would be same right yeah so the intent the intent to say is that uh you will be able to like by using exactly the same method as we used for the inverter you should be able to build transfer characteristics for any other gate also so sir like can i also say that with the inverter itself the inverter structure only if i change the data ratios in the inverted structure i can get the different characteristics of the other gates also this is what you're saying i mean here i'm not saying that what i'm saying is that if you change the beta ratio you will get different characteristics what i'm also saying is that by using the same method you can build characteristics of other gates also which if they are inverting gates would be very similar to the inverter characteristics if they are non-inverting gates the characteristics would be different but by using the same method you can arrive at transfer characteristics of any curve lining so like you did with the current graph like intersecting points okay so but like what is the relevance of this changes beta ratio i mean as a designer why i'm looking at this because so as i mentioned we will cover it later also but since there is a question uh see at times you may want my inverter to not switch so the next slide will see at times for example if you look at this over here suppose this is the characteristic that that we have designed for our inverter now what happens let v in change by even this much value v in can now change by this much value but output will not change are you able to see this okay so so that can also discover itself it will mean that uh the pmos will be like the for pmos to be pmos and uh nmos current to be equal the pull down so that means the linear current of n must be sufficient to counter the circuit energy current of the p noise so fast for this particular curve the p mass is much bigger than the n mass okay so the saturation current of the n mass will be more than easily encountered taken care of by the linear current of the p mass yeah yeah yes okay so now what has happened my low noise margin i have increased but what happened to the high noise margin now if my input was at one over here even a small blip would mean my output will go to 1. so my higher noise margin has reduced okay yeah that's the relevance of this bit direction yeah so if you change the skew ratio if you change the skewing and the beta ratio then you will essentially end up changing the noise margins that your gate would have okay we'll just come to that in the meanwhile i saw that someone had a question you had a question so so i understood uh if beta p is greater than beta and then the curve is shifting towards right and uh also it is shifting towards left but is much greater than beta n then the saturation current of nmos is much lesser than even the linear current of pmos [Music] so even with the you know even though nmos is trying to sync as much current as it can the linear current of the pmos is so high that it kind of does not allow the output capacitance to discharge okay okay we are not doing transient analysis yet but what we are saying is that the uh the current of the pmos in the linear region is so high that n mass even in saturation cannot sink more current okay that is where my characteristics become something like this yes i can can you please explain this low noise and high noise yeah i will just come to that i will just know there's a separate site for that okay sir uh yes sir sir so you were saying that with the no i said by using the method of how we built the inverter characteristics we should be able to build characteristics okay so we're talking about the method not exactly that inverter so just a small follow up in this only so for example when you are saying that we can extend this method to other gates also they would be looking at the what the current is going in the pull-up network and the pull-down network as a whole right and then we even have to apply this kind of characteristics yes okay we will talk about pull-up network and pull-down network and we will have to keep other inputs in such a situation that they do not influence the output okay i did not i still didn't understand the last pointer that the other gates collapsed [Music] gate and my one input is already let us say one this input was zero this input b was zero now what happens when b goes from zero to one what will happen if you want to find the transfer graph yeah if you want to find the transfer characteristics of this gate now what would you do you would you would keep b at different values of uh voltage v and you will gradually change and do you realize that this this inverter or this nmos is just like a some on resistance r on and this p mass is actually off so this doesn't even figure in into our analysis at such a high resistance so we are essentially looking at idp and idn this damsync has much current because it is fully one how was the other uh transistor of that r of which you just because the input is one so the pmos is off there okay yeah yeah okay so this nand gate do you see it is kind of collapsed into an inverter okay okay so that is what i mean by that statement nothing else so um about you know the skewed gate influencing the characteristics of other gates so when when this collapses into an equivalent uh inverter it will

greater than much greater than beta n right right yeah so uh such curves you know such transistors which we have such inverters or such gates where we have uh beta n not equal to beta p you would notice that the the infection point will be on either side of vdd by two okay these are called skewed gates there is importance there is a relevance for these gates we will look at that a little later in the course but i just want you to keep that in your mind you know park it for yourself that this is how uh like this this characteristic that we just did can be used to represent skewed gates also and this vowed by v incur can be used to actually represent any other gate also just that because of different beta ratio your curve could be over here or over here so are you able to see this yes sir yes so what do you mean by the other gates and this like nand gate nor gate xor gate five input nand gate two input nand gate three input nand gate all the various range of gates that you may want to use in your designs later so both of the all these gates will have these kind of characteristics only yeah all these girls will have v out by v in characteristic is it not same okay the trend would be the same not same because beta ratio will be different they will have slightly different but the trend would be same right yeah so the intent the intent to say is that uh you will be able to like by using exactly the same method as we used for the inverter you should be able to build transfer characteristics for any other gate also so sir like can i also say that with the inverter itself the inverter structure only if i change the data ratios in the inverted structure i can get the different characteristics of the other gates also this is what you're saying i mean here i'm not saying that what i'm saying is that if you change the beta ratio you will get different characteristics what i'm also saying is that by using the same method you can build characteristics of other gates also which if they are inverting gates would be very similar to the inverter characteristics if they are non-inverting gates the characteristics would be different but by using the same method you can arrive at transfer characteristics of any curve lining so like you did with the current graph like intersecting points okay so but like what is the relevance of this changes beta ratio i mean as a designer why i'm looking at this because so as i mentioned we will cover it later also but since there is a question uh see at times you may want my inverter to not switch so the next slide will see at times for example if you look at this over here suppose this is the characteristic that that we have designed for our inverter now what happens let v in change by even this much value v in can now change by this much value but output will not change are you able to see this okay so so that can also discover itself it will mean that uh the pmos will be like the for pmos to be pmos and uh nmos current to be equal the pull down so that means the linear current of n must be sufficient to counter the circuit energy current of the p noise so fast for this particular curve the p mass is much bigger than the n mass okay so the saturation current of the n mass will be more than easily encountered taken care of by the linear current of the p mass yeah yeah yes okay so now what has happened my low noise margin i have increased but what happened to the high noise margin now if my input was at one over here even a small blip would mean my output will go to 1. so my higher noise margin has reduced okay yeah that's the relevance of this bit direction yeah so if you change the skew ratio if you change the skewing and the beta ratio then you will essentially end up changing the noise margins that your gate would have okay we'll just come to that in the meanwhile i saw that someone had a question you had a question so so i understood uh if beta p is greater than beta and then the curve is shifting towards right and uh also it is shifting towards left but is much greater than beta n then the saturation current of nmos is much lesser than even the linear current of pmos [Music] so even with the you know even though nmos is trying to sync as much current as it can the linear current of the pmos is so high that it kind of does not allow the output capacitance to discharge okay okay we are not doing transient analysis yet but what we are saying is that the uh the current of the pmos in the linear region is so high that n mass even in saturation cannot sink more current okay that is where my characteristics become something like this yes i can can you please explain this low noise and high noise yeah i will just come to that i will just know there's a separate site for that okay sir uh yes sir sir so you were saying that with the no i said by using the method of how we built the inverter characteristics we should be able to build characteristics okay so we're talking about the method not exactly that inverter so just a small follow up in this only so for example when you are saying that we can extend this method to other gates also they would be looking at the what the current is going in the pull-up network and the pull-down network as a whole right and then we even have to apply this kind of characteristics yes okay we will talk about pull-up network and pull-down network and we will have to keep other inputs in such a situation that they do not influence the output okay i did not i still didn't understand the last pointer that the other gates collapsed [Music] gate and my one input is already let us say one this input was zero this input b was zero now what happens when b goes from zero to one what will happen if you want to find the transfer graph yeah if you want to find the transfer characteristics of this gate now what would you do you would you would keep b at different values of uh voltage v and you will gradually change and do you realize that this this inverter or this nmos is just like a some on resistance r on and this p mass is actually off so this doesn't even figure in into our analysis at such a high resistance so we are essentially looking at idp and idn this damsync has much current because it is fully one how was the other uh transistor of that r of which you just because the input is one so the pmos is off there okay yeah yeah okay so this nand gate do you see it is kind of collapsed into an inverter okay okay so that is what i mean by that statement nothing else so um about you know the skewed gate influencing the characteristics of other gates so when when this collapses into an equivalent uh inverter it will also"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,WMW0XjpJhfs,so sir our main job would be to select the inputs so that we get those equivalent kind of structures right yeah yeah you can do that okay so now as we were saying just just now that if i have a if i have an inverter which is uh toggling at say vdd by 2 what what am i saying that on the low side i have this kind of region where output will not toggle and on the high side i have this kind of region where again output will not double it is in this region that i would not know or in fact behave in a you could say over here between here and here it is in this region that i have i do not know where my output is are you able to see this so this is called as logical high input range and logical no input low input range and the output as we said will always go to either vdd or ground so logical low output range and logical high output range that when when the output has risen to let us say 80 percent of vdd we say it is high we don't really need it to be full vdd huh and this this difference between them is called as noise margin okay and if we have a skewed gate this gate would either go here or here and because of which noise margin of one side may reduce noise margin on the other side would increase because what would happen the output would still output ah high and output low range would still remain the same but input intermediate range would shift up let us say like this so what has happened the noise margin on the high side has reduced whereas that on the low side increases are you able to see this any questions so what is significance of this noise margin okay uh we were talking about crosstalk what will crosstalk do it will generate some small pulses here and there some glitches here and there so you do not want your outputs to keep traveling for every little glitch so that is what this noise margin prevents it saves power so noise will now not bother your circuit your outputs will not unnecessarily toggle because of noise so so my input has to be in uh in has to be above this noise margin or it can be in this noise margin as well um so that we have with extent so in this case my input can actually be in this noise margin and i will still consider it as logical high that is what the definition of noise margin is my output will remain here that is the strength of my gate but this is additional margin that i am giving that even if i input a slightly lower than my output high range i will still be able to uh consider that as one okay so that if output of one gate is fed into another the in the noise cannot er and noise get overlapped with uh yeah so let us look at it like this i made a very good output curve over here i i followed this okay now in between i had some coupling capacitance coming into picture with another wire and therefore by the time it reached here my output fell a little i was giving an output high of this its output was high but it fell a little so it came to this level now for this particular inverter i would still consider it as a high signal so whatever crosstalk this wire introduced into my system it did not spoil the logic level i had sufficient noise margin noise introduced by this adjacent buyer did not change my output okay so got yourself okay yes sir yes okay so uh i'm still not getting this point like uh if we have input greater than that c region then the output will be low intermediate then the output will be my first inverter gave the outputs of logical high and logical low like whatever is drawn yes now in this long path there was some crosstalk yes we added some noise okay how much noise can this crosstalk add or another reason could be adding noise how much noise can be added that my second inverter still considers it as one okay so that is my noise margin height okay similarly on the low side if i had this first inverter giving an output 0 how much noise can this crosstalk add so that the second inverter is still considered okay that is in noise noise raster mad you know i have become i have become insensitive to the noise that got added in in the in the process of some other output reaching my input gate okay huh okay you can now notice here i have become insensitive to that noise that is why it is called noise margin okay so okay because if more noise could be would be inserted then i do not know what my output would be okay yes uh sir in this picture itself the left one is the characteristics of the left uh output characteristics of the first inverter and the right one is the inverter of the characteristics of the second water right so but like i wanted to ask for a given inverter if the this intermediate region the area for example if you consider this area itself this would be fixed right this can only shift up and down yeah no not exactly depends on technology and voltage of operation so because uh right current knowledge uh like the voltage but that could be using for different inverters that would be same so so like even this uh if fish change the beta ratio then this either i will get the noise margin increased on the high side or the low side so one has to compensate on the behalf of other there will be some loss so so like this region then has to remain constant but no that that is an assumption you are making raghav in the previous slide we simply said that this region will go up or low i did not really say that this region will remain constant also for example look at this curve in this case this region is this big at least yes sir but look at this curve the original one this region is probably smaller so how would this region change i do not know there is no way to uh clearly look at tell it based on some model or some what do you say analysis uh see if you you will actually have to analyze the the inverter on on your card to seek exactly so actually i was making the deduction based on the fact that for example if i'm able to change this area this transition area then i can have gains on both the low side on the also the high side also typically if you if you skew it typically if you skew it this indeterminate region would all would probably increase because what happens is they look at this either stop here this goes bad okay okay so like okay like in that kind of situation in which i gain on both of that cannot happen so that may not happen yeah that you will probably be able to do if you increase the voltage of operation yeah yeah okay generally you are saying sir that this beta ratio affects this in that the area increases so like the degradation has to be it will be more amplified than basically than if you would have not been there but it's shifting also it wasn't shifting i'm not saying that also rather i simply said i do not know what to say about indeterminate region it can increase it can remain constant it could reduce it depends on the technology and voltage of operation and what kind of skew you are talking about that's all that i said okay sir yes sir uh so can you please go back to the previous slide servants yes sir so sir in this graph for suppose we are taking uh vdd by 2 at the center point and the graph is the same beta p by beta n equal to 1 so in that noise margin is something that's that we are giving the flexibility towards the top side and the bottom side axle so like the top side we are calling it as noise margin high the bottom side you are calling it as noise margin low okay okay there is no relevance i'm like we don't call the between areas any kind of noise or something no you see that that is where nmh and nml yes yes okay so how to maximize noise margin yes ma'am yeah uh can you go back to the previous slide please noise emergence this is also on nice margin only tell me no i mean the the last last one yeah so here um on the top we have indicated vdd and on the bottom g uh round but um according to the inverter characteristics this top one should indicate uh when we say logical high input range we mean that the range of inputs for which the output will be logical high rate no logical low logical low inverter inverter will invert logical high input range it will convert to logical low output range so what's this uh what's the logic of you know subtracting your output range from the input range let us both are identical inverters okay this inverter gives its output based on this output characteristic the output when it starts from here and reaches the input of the second inverter there is crosstalk in between which introduces noise okay now the inverter at its receiving input stage considers a much wider range as logic high right right so what does this mean that this much of noise nmh kind of noise can be accepted from crosstalk or any other reason okay okay that is why it is called as noise margin right right okay and just clear this line inside just clarifying this statement like we have this noise margin like this much noise we can tolerate and if the noise is greater than this then the operation will be entered am i right sir we do not know what the output would be yeah okay okay so thank you okay so i i know these these many questions because we want to increase the noise margin so how do we increase the noise margin so uh we can i think we can make beta p equal to beta n so that our curve was steep at a point so that we would have a good noise motion on the top and the bottom yeah so if beta p is equal to beta n that is how we can do it what is now how do we first before that we need to see what is really the noise margin should i start to call noise margin from here until here or from where to where so a typical definition that is used is that in this transfer characteristic the points where i have a unity slope from zero to one and one to zero side those are the the intermediate region is called as in the the region between that is intermediate region and i have the remaining part as noise margin is that okay so you will get v o l and v o h from this curve and v i l and v i h also from this curve so now i will be able to identify what is the noise margin for this particular gate so like in short we are saying that when both the devices are in saturation we exclude that area and then the remaining response you can say that okay so having looked at this and having also talked about transient analysis a little while back we understand that dc analysis is what happens to v out if v n is constant transient analysis is what happens to v out if v in changes over time and we also discussed already that the same kind of characteristic will stay stay valid you just need to time you know you just need to put a b c d e along the time axis okay we already discussed this in the last class also this is just kind of summarizing it but when we do that there are different figures of merit which would also come into picture and that is what we need to look at okay so what we are saying that uh at time t equal to t naught my input is toggling and uh my output was vdd at time t less than t naught how would my output change after time t equal to t naught and you notice c load starts to figure in now we already discussed in the last class in response to one of your questions that why did we not consider c load in the stat in the char in the uh transfer active sticks because it is the input outputs are not changing so capacitance is not valid however uh in a transient analysis we know that v out is changing over time therefore c load starts to figure in what will be the impact of c load on the current waveforms any ideas [Music] uh my word okay so if i'm transitioning from zero to one my output should be going from one to zero why would pmos be sourcing more current now sorry in case you of the reverse logic because now we're uh about zero to one transition only we're talking about zero to one transition only a b okay and this night we're talking about zero to one you're talking about response to a unit input so zero to one transition happening there what is the response to that so my question is how will the current change so we are talking here about step response right yes response to the step input this step input i think at the edges where this changes there would be a bulb unlike there would be a u-shaped curve going high then it's rising and while followed it will go down are we falling we are only looking at input rise then eight will go over there and then bulp at the edge at which the value is one so i'm asking about the current curve so maybe the uh curve will be uh more wider because there will be more charge stored in the c load so the i versus t will be more wider rather than a peak okay so uh what is being said is that because there is a load over here this would prevent any change in output voltage this will resist any change in output voltage it will start to sink it's on charge so that output doesn't change and therefore my delays would increase and therefore this curve would become wider is that what you want to say yes sir okay and anything else would happen so see in the transfer characteristics we said id n is equal to idp can we say this here no transfer practices this was always the case can we say the same thing here no sir why so as i can think for example if we in b have no control b being changing as we have applied so if being is changing so i know that for this particular time of period my pmos will be on my nmos will be on but this v out i think is because of c load because of this i think i'm not able to able to say that e what time my pms will be in linear saturation so these kind of the current i think i won't be able to stay sometimes mad this uh pmos will be linear and must be saturation and this current is also going so i mean sometimes i think that maybe the pmos could be driving more current to the sea load and see let us look at it very simply just if we know the output is going to be zero now we know that this capacitance has to discharge capacitor currents so this capacitance the charge that this capacitor has has to be sunk to zero yes sir yeah so the nmas will finally sink more charge than the p mass yeah so the nmos current has to be or either the duration of the nmos current or the amount of nmos current whatever we talk about has to be more than the pmos current yeah during that transition also right so ids cannot be equal to idsp ids n cannot be equal to idsp yes in fact it could be something like this only not but there is a pmos current which also comes but pmos current closes n mass remains in the saturation region for a little longer it discharges the capacitor and then enters into the linear region so this could be the first curve over here could be idsp and the second workforce could be ids n are you able to see this so nmos remained in saturation for a longer period so that it would sink the charge from c load this this region should be able to give you the charge stored on c load are you able to see this yes sir yeah so the power will definitely increase because this uh this region is charge given by the pmos and must took all that charge okay this was the extra charge so this extra charge represents the charge coming from the capacitor so if you are just given the current characteristics you can find out the capacitance that is connected on the load are you able to see this yeah yeah yes i did thank you very much was initially charged somewhat of what how is that that charge left out which the capacitor is just producing afterwards will continue to remain in saturation region for a longer duration of time and only then capacitance discharges it will go into linear region so then its current would discharge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMW0XjpJhfs,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMW0XjpJhfs
Transcript: so sir our main job would be to select the inputs so that we get those equivalent kind of structures right yeah yeah you can do that okay so now as we were saying just just now that if i have a if i have an inverter which is uh toggling at say vdd by 2 what what am i saying that on the low side i have this kind of region where output will not toggle and on the high side i have this

saturation region for a little longer it discharges the capacitor and then enters into the linear region so this could be the first curve over here could be idsp and the second workforce could be ids n are you able to see this so nmos remained in saturation for a longer period so that it would sink the charge from c load this this region should be able to give you the charge stored on c load are you able to see this yes sir yeah so the power will definitely increase because this uh this region is charge given by the pmos and must took all that charge okay this was the extra charge so this extra charge represents the charge coming from the capacitor so if you are just given the current characteristics you can find out the capacitance that is connected on the load are you able to see this yeah yeah yes i did thank you very much was initially charged somewhat of what how is that that charge left out which the capacitor is just producing afterwards will continue to remain in saturation region for a longer duration of time and only then capacitance discharges it will go into linear region so then its current would discharge"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,6cFWYI9sBJw,now we look at now because you're talking about transient characteristics and now we say that there is going to be some capacitors which are going to get charged or discharged or stuff like that so now we look at uh different timings that we have talked about already or you know you have seen that in the assignment already so there are different kinds of delays propagation delays are you know there is a propagation delay from input rising so output falling propagation delay from uh input falling to output rising so this is tpdr ppdf you may also be called reading it as tp uh hl or t p l h something like this okay and average of these two is used to say what is the average propagation delay okay and the rise time and the fall time that you looked at in your assignment also is about uh the slope of the output which would depend on the load that we have is that okay these four timings any question they are simple you've already done the assignment on that also okay so now there is another set of delays which are called as contamination delays what do you think contamination delays are uh you've done an assignment on inverter you will not be able to respond on contamination delay based on the inverter let us consider a nand gate now can you think of a contamination delay the definition appears to be similar to propagation delay yes sir so this is best case delay earliest that my output can bubble consider the case of a nand gate so we will go into this in more detail in a little while now let us say on the on the zero to one side uh you know output transitioning from zero to one because a and b have are kind of in parallel with each other so the delays will always be the same however if just one of them is toggling but what happens if both of them toggle together so if one of them was toggling either a or toggling or b toggling this could be my output waveform but when both toggle together what happens i have extra drive strength to to charge this capacitor and therefore my delay so my input would have been let us say input went low here so my input to output delay now reduces this lesser delay is called as contamination delay okay so yes can you please explain this last part again so uh are you able to see that when both a and p a and b are simultaneously driving the output capacitance it will transition faster yes sir so instead of this transition i will see a much faster transition on the output okay so the difference between these two okay now okay yes so just like you have pdr and pdf you have contamin contamination delay rising and contamination delay calling and average contamination delay associated with the gates why is contamination delay important sir this determines the speed at which the output switches so why am i interested in the shortest delay also typically i should be interested in only the longest delay yes i even that is my question i mean shortest but someone was saying something so so qualifying the uh combinational path delay requirements in a synchronous circuit yeah so usually you look at you know longest delay path that is what you call the critical path so choice all of you are saying whole time also the punk yes so contamination delay is important to validate the whole time paths you've done flip flops what is set up time and hold time of a flip flop hello before which uh uh just the range for which uh the data uh should remain stable for the blockage so that the flip flop should uh capture that that data and uh after that blockage the that time is called the whole time so the range surface of data should again remain stable so that it perfectly captures the data any other response so b-tech students you also done the setup and hold times in your eld and other courses dc erdberg [Music] the amount of time we will have to hold our d input constant before the rising temperature and whole time and whole time is um the amount of time after the clock edge for which d should because yeah so now do you realize that the contamination delay can mean that your output can now change faster so your whole time violations can appear if you do not consider contamination delay in your analysis therefore both propagation delay and contamination delay are to be characterized for any gate that you will design in your projects also so i still did not understand how it is uh rising faster in this case i mean if a and b are switching together so let us say a was a a was one initially and b was also one both were one okay so output was 0 0 now let us say only a goes to 0 yes what would happen a device of width w wp will charge the capacitor yes in a different case only b goes to zero what would happen a device of only bits w will charge the capacitor now let us consider a case where both simultaneously go to zero what two devices charging it up means double the current okay yeah that means that the password will get charged faster okay okay raghav uh yes yes i wanted to ask that i get it that this whole time requirement we are considering contamination but so for example as i can see like the setup time is much more than the whole time requirements i mean but from this for example so this when you're seeing this whole time required contamination delay i mean i will always get some kind of delay so why i'm burying why i am basically modeling it because i just want this delay to be there so it will be always be there so like in calculations like how it will help me so uh we will look at that uh in longer paths later raghav but for now realize that we have for any design we have to qualify setup and hold both am i right yes sir yeah yes sir and to be able to analyze the whole path i need the fastest delays okay so because i have to analyze that as a sign of requirement i need the fastest delay also so as a library designer you have to characterize both the propagation delay and the contamination delay so so like for example when i am characterizing this whole delay i will toggle both the inputs a and b at the same time and i will get what the delay will get will be my contamination delay but so then how will i model the other delay because then basically so there are different kinds of so if you will open the dot lift file of any gate so there is a there is a format in which the input to output delays are characterized yes sir okay so in that format there is an option to also to add two delays linked between two pins that a to y there is there is one propagation delay and there is one contamination delay so you have an option to add both the delays and one file itself the tools that will do the static timing analysis will take care of both the you know delays i am asking that what how i will basically come up with this uh another delay apart from the contamination rate because then i can basically depending upon how much difference i'm getting between the a input and the input toggling i can get different kind of delays yeah so i have done three simulations i will in one simulation i will toggle only a i will get a to y delay and second simulation i will toggle only b i will get b to y delay and then third simulation i will toggle a and b both and i will get the a a slash b to y delay so i'll take an average off yeah okay okay okay the max will become the propagation delay the min will become the contamination delay i know so either i do three simulations or i i do i make my stimuli in such a way that in one simulation it says i'm able to calculate all three of them that is a that is a choice every designer has so i understood that okay now two devices are have charged the capacitor but now when it when it has to discharge right so again i mean if not discharging through the nmos now how does having two nmos um in series help in faster discharging of the capacitor so let us look at it thank you because this is something we want to discuss in just a little while also so thank you for bringing it up now we can discuss it now itself let us say this node had a small capacitance cx over here let us say can we say this yeah now my input my output was at one initially and it has to now go to zero huh so what happened either of a or b was 0 which has now gone to 1 which means it has to discharge now let us first assume that b was 1 already a has now gone 1 what happens because d was already one the cx is already discharged to ground okay so there will be one delay right right now let us say a was one a was one already and b was zero so b is going to one now now what happens not just this one has to discharge the cx also has to discharge okay so this delay will be longer yes so one of the propagation delays will be more than the other propagation delay so these capacitors like cx we have face it's uh it's basically your according to your equivalent models right when we um study the equilibrium models for rc uh in steam because diffusion capacitance shear diffusion finger devices all that you're talking about extra capacitances on source and drain yeah yeah yeah so that is exactly what we're talking about over here

diffusion capacitance shear diffusion finger devices all that you're talking about extra capacitances on source and drain yeah yeah yeah so that is exactly what we're talking about over here okay"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,_Gx_rVnCYSY,yes sir sir i mean i am not able to really get this uh kind of the the delay uh for this when you're saying that if b is toggle one and then it will be longer for that and not everyone's gonna get it so we'll just see we will just look at the delays model we will just see that don't worry okay so now we look at various models of delays one simple model is you assume that there is some you know when when the input changes there is an i average that will flow and the capacitor would discharge this model will give you know i need to find this value of n and everything two to be able to come up with an accurate delay another model could be you say that okay there is an effective r on the device is on there is an effective r on the capacitor swallowed at one and this discharges through this resistor so that is another way to model the propagation delay through an inverter ion method is usually simpler because r on estimation for a linear region you can still do much more easily and instead of you know calculating the i average from this kind of occurs you remember this transfer characteristic to find out i average of this transfer correction can be very tricky so this uh you know iron model is is usually a simpler model to work with also more intuitive actually okay uh so if you have a uh input transitioning from uh like in this blue curve from zero to one and then from one to zero the output will transition from one to zero and zero to one and your propagation delay would be measured something like this equivalent resistance of the uh n mass plus equivalent to this from the p mass divided by two but can you tell me why uh yeah this equivalent resistance can you tell me why this happens who can tell me we already discussed this in one of the offices also but i just want to review with you why does this happen in the past because it's a coupling capacitance between the capacitance because of that coupling capacitance between what so i mean the input and the output like the gate input with the output right it gets the miller the capacitance capacitance that we talked about where we said that an analog circuit should be much more relevant but you see in digital circuits also we see these notches because as the gate as the gate input goes from zero to one there is a coupling with source entrain there the source is ground or vdd that is that will not change much but the other side which is not driven to vdd or ground that side will is a floating capacitor so it will see some extra buildup of charge and this uh this is what you will see observe in the transient response okay it can also be understood you know in some cases like when you will talk about memory design and stuff like that so it will also be understood like that there is a inversion layer here when the device is on there is an inversion layer here and when you turn it off all at once this charge has to go somewhere this charge will go to the source or drain region half will go towards the source half will go to the drain and that will appear as this this is also another way to look at it this this phenomena also happens okay there are two things that come into picture so actually so essentially cgd and the cgs are getting coupled with the cr right yeah yes that is what is coming into picture so if you want to improve the performance what do you do the formula is cl into r so if we can keep the load capacitance to be small we would improve the delays if we can keep the self-loading because we know that the drain of the nmos and the pmos also become a part of float capacitance to be small we will get lesser capacitance if i increase the sizes what happens r on and like r on off the p mass and the n mass would decrease so i can improve the delays there but as i do that what happens abhim nakata keep the drain capacitance is small if you increase the device sizes what happens to the drain capacitances diffusion capacitance increases diffusion capacitance increases so this is called as self loading so you just cannot keep on increasing the size after some time you will not see any benefit because the device is loading itself so you are reducing the r equivalent but capacitance is also increasing so it is kind of a self-defeating mechanism after some time and then what about vdd the r equivalent seems to be dependent on vdd somewhere what would you do to vdd you would want to increase the vdd to reduce delays or decrease variety to reduce delay so we need to increase supply you need to increase the vdd why sir because [Music] the current would increase again uh on increasing the variation okay so because current would increase my overall resistance would reduce yes okay raghav you have a question uh yes sir i have some questions so for example in this overloading thing uh because if we increase the size too much this peak that we are seeing that will basically become too much that is the effect we will be seeing overloading self loading yeah so this peak will become too much and it will become enlarged over the time that you're saying effectively no i did not use the word enlarge did i use the wooden latch so i mean this uh maximum peak range would increase right so you're saying maximum peak may increase because of bigger device bigger more charge in the channel region yes but the duration of this peak i did not comment anything about because the devices are bigger than the discharge would also be faster so even if the peak is higher it will discharge equally fast okay so so like what do you exactly we did not use the word overloading we use the word self-loading yeah self-loading is the capacitance on the of the mosfet itself out coming as coming on the output see there is some cd over here yeah yes yes i know so this is c out so the cd is in parallel with c out as you increase the device size the cd increases yes yes so effectively see how it increases for you yeah that is what is being talked about over here that happened but and so my other question was that's the higher modeling this uh like r on thing with the like what value like how will we model this transistor with the r on i get it that would be the channel resistance but like i give you the complete formula you use this formula to find out your addon so which this other formula this one r equivalent okay okay okay same integration [Music] there are equations which with which you can do all of that don't worry so if you just add something more you will actually be able to identify full delay through some equations okay so so we have to get use these formulas to get the r on equivalent if i give you such questions which involves these formulas then i will also give the formula with it okay don't worry i don't want you to remember all this crap these are long channel models not even valid today okay these are you know simpler estimations just to give you an idea okay the intent being that when you look at this formula you should know that okay if i improve if i increase the vdd the delay would reduce if i reduce this then the delay would increase and so on that kind of estimate you should be able to make out of such formula okay so this is what you're talking about and we're talking about self-loading as you increase the device i see initially the delays improve so quickly but up after some time because of self-loading the slope degrades finally the slope is so bad that you are increasing the size of the device see 8 10 12 you're increasing the size of the device but the delay is not really changing much you've increased the size of the device by how much 50 how much has the delay changed not even five percent so yes it's a bit of probably but all these optimizations we are doing so are we trying to decrease the rise and fall time or the uh rising and falling propagation uh we are more interested in propagation delay see rise time and fall time we talked about are important to reduce power okay so if you will do this then power would also reduce but see increasing the size also means increase in capacitances so a power buddy so when we're talking about delays you're only talking about delay ruby so i mean um what what are the ways of reducing rise and fall times because intuitively the same methods should be applied yes intuitively the same methods have to be applied and you will notice that uh if you reduce the load capacitance in some way right so self loading for the rise and fall time would start to appear much faster much earlier yes yes because cluster is charging yes that's it okay so so can you come back to this uh discussion when we're discussing the effect of vdd on the delays so i can see from the equation that the resistance was also proportional to the vdd but you said that if i increase the vdd my delays would increase certain decrease the resistance was proportional to uh inversely proportional to id also you notice that okay and this has vd's vdd in it again yeah so there is the serial that is getting subtracted also so vdd increases this thing would also reduce both complexes so you have to do you have to do numerical analysis to arrive at the answer okay so like presently i'm saying that if i increase the bdd my delays would reduce right yes okay similarly for for beta ratio as you change the beta ratio the delays will there will be a sweet spot where the low to high and high to low delays would both be lower and you will you will have a beta ratio range which you would want to keep in your design okay so beta ratio you will see will typically in the theme of 65 also you want to keep it between 1.5 to 2.75 2.6 something like that okay uh we already discussed this that we are looking at first order rc response which is a decaying exponential they're talking about delay as uh effective resistance into capacitance and uh we we're really looking at you know essentially average current and all those things but this is too inaccurate to predict current at any given time but good enough to predict the rc delays if we try to look at the model of the delay you know r on we can say that a device which is k times a unit device size would have r by k the effective r on and k c as the effective load capacitance is this thing clear to you so this case is the diffusion one right kc times the same yeah the the load capacitance because of drain and source region okay so c would be when the we have unit yes okay now what happens with the pmos we say that the p mass the resistance is already 2r because of mobility constraints so for the pmos the capacitance capacitances will move in the same ratio in fact the resistance would also move in the same ratio but final resistance will be not r by k but 2 r by k because even in a unit unit thing the capacitor resistance was 2r so what essentially we are seeing is capacitance is proportional to it resistance is inversely proportional to it uh why is unity uh why does your females have a resistance to work i'm sorry uh what's the reason for unit teamers having resistance uh because the mobility of the p masses uh the hose is lesser than the mobility of the electrons so see what they discussed you will fall back up on all of that only no they behave the same way the resistance is because the mobility of the end masses is uh of the mobility of the electrons is better than the mobility of the hose therefore resistance of the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gx_rVnCYSY,"Link:

make out of such formula okay so this is what you're talking about and we're talking about self-loading as you increase the device i see initially the delays improve so quickly but up after some time because of self-loading the slope degrades finally the slope is so bad that you are increasing the size of the device see 8 10 12 you're increasing the size of the device but the delay is not really changing much you've increased the size of the device by how much 50 how much has the delay changed not even five percent so yes it's a bit of probably but all these optimizations we are doing so are we trying to decrease the rise and fall time or the uh rising and falling propagation uh we are more interested in propagation delay see rise time and fall time we talked about are important to reduce power okay so if you will do this then power would also reduce but see increasing the size also means increase in capacitances so a power buddy so when we're talking about delays you're only talking about delay ruby so i mean um what what are the ways of reducing rise and fall times because intuitively the same methods should be applied yes intuitively the same methods have to be applied and you will notice that uh if you reduce the load capacitance in some way right so self loading for the rise and fall time would start to appear much faster much earlier yes yes because cluster is charging yes that's it okay so so can you come back to this uh discussion when we're discussing the effect of vdd on the delays so i can see from the equation that the resistance was also proportional to the vdd but you said that if i increase the vdd my delays would increase certain decrease the resistance was proportional to uh inversely proportional to id also you notice that okay and this has vd's vdd in it again yeah so there is the serial that is getting subtracted also so vdd increases this thing would also reduce both complexes so you have to do you have to do numerical analysis to arrive at the answer okay so like presently i'm saying that if i increase the bdd my delays would reduce right yes okay similarly for for beta ratio as you change the beta ratio the delays will there will be a sweet spot where the low to high and high to low delays would both be lower and you will you will have a beta ratio range which you would want to keep in your design okay so beta ratio you will see will typically in the theme of 65 also you want to keep it between 1.5 to 2.75 2.6 something like that okay uh we already discussed this that we are looking at first order rc response which is a decaying exponential they're talking about delay as uh effective resistance into capacitance and uh we we're really looking at you know essentially average current and all those things but this is too inaccurate to predict current at any given time but good enough to predict the rc delays if we try to look at the model of the delay you know r on we can say that a device which is k times a unit device size would have r by k the effective r on and k c as the effective load capacitance is this thing clear to you so this case is the diffusion one right kc times the same yeah the the load capacitance because of drain and source region okay so c would be when the we have unit yes okay now what happens with the pmos we say that the p mass the resistance is already 2r because of mobility constraints so for the pmos the capacitance capacitances will move in the same ratio in fact the resistance would also move in the same ratio but final resistance will be not r by k but 2 r by k because even in a unit unit thing the capacitor resistance was 2r so what essentially we are seeing is capacitance is proportional to it resistance is inversely proportional to it uh why is unity uh why does your females have a resistance to work i'm sorry uh what's the reason for unit teamers having resistance uh because the mobility of the p masses uh the hose is lesser than the mobility of the electrons so see what they discussed you will fall back up on all of that only no they behave the same way the resistance is because the mobility of the end masses is uh of the mobility of the electrons is better than the mobility of the hose therefore resistance of the"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,fDntVpDkcec,masses twice and we have this uh factor of two because uh we need to maintain the same beta ratio yeah yeah so so no no no so we assumed that mobility of the hose is one by half the mobility of the electrons that is y2r yes yes now to get same delays uh same rise and fall delays you make an inverter with the ratio two is to one okay yeah so and nmus both have same delay yes okay and then you can estimate the delay of an inverter by making an equivalent rc model and you will notice that equivalent delay of a inverter is 6 rc can you work it out over here so we are looking at delay from zero to one what happens nmos is on pmos is off so this particular resistance and capacitance completely goes out of picture we only see this 2c this 2c c c and r and c now this c is between ground and ground so this also capacitance goes out of picture this is my final model 1r and 6c so the delay of an inverter is 6rc so can you explain this whole thing again so do you remember this this is this mosfet the mosfet says that there is a gate capacitance there is source and drain capacitance and there is a resistance yeah i just put the same models for the nmos and the p mosses over here nothing else okay okay and then what i've done is i've removed the invalid capacitances now this part is not in picture so i've removed this part and i've come to an equivalent circuit okay okay okay so the delay of this is 6rc okay but where did the um so we have placed one inverter one after the other but so for the second inverter i mean at node y we have just included the capacitances yeah why do we need to include anything else that is only the gate load no okay if i have to measure the delay of this particular inverter the output only acts as load capacitive load it's only going to the gate okay so for for load purposes yeah you have to take the fan out for considering the load [Music] and the gate but while this we are showing only the source and the drain capacitances and the gate i'm not able to see how his gate model like why is that you tell me will will there be any current that will flow through the gate i mean no sir no then why do i need to show it the gate is somewhere here it's here let this be here how does it matter so but for the uh second stage the input capacitance will be parallel with this right now later okay so we get the inverted delay to be 6rc now a little complex skate so and you will notice that this rc model is actually reasonably accurate look at the spice model and a very a shockley model there are multiple models so look at different models and you will see this is reasonably accurate at least what at fifty percent transition this is very accurate so back of the calculations this method should work fine okay so now what about a three input nand gate what will you do do you realize you will have to size it something like this hello set to maintain will propagation delay i'm sorry sir we are sizing it in this way uh just to maintain equal uh propagation dealer right yes sizing it like this so that it has an equivalent delay of an inverter only so now how is the delays move over here first first are you able to see this is the equivalent inverter delay sizing so if i make an uh you know if if i consider if i consider that there are these three inverters in series then by having 3 i have resistances of r by 3 over here effective resistance is r so this sizing of 3 means that i have the effective r on equivalent to a unit inverter are you able to see this so now that i have the size of 3 how will my capacitances scale they will scale something like this wherever it was 2 it has i have 2c wherever it was 3 i have 3c now again what will i do i will remove the redundant capacitances which are the redundant capacitances the capacitances on the input over here for example or or capacitance between ground and uh and itself or capacitance between vdd and itself so those capacitances i will remove to simplify this on this circuit so how what happens so this is my effective capacitance graph which ones that added 2 c 2 c 2c 2c so 6c and 3c so 9c on the output the other capacitances that are valid are these 3 c capacitances are you with me hello yes sir now let us put the resistances also there so a quick refresh we know the elmore's equation that to get propagation delay i have to do some of our i2 source to ci so r1 c1 plus r1 plus r2 c2 plus r1 plus r2 plus rn 2 cn we remember this we already covered this in last or last to last class elmo's delay so if we apply this on our equivalent circuit now what happens let us say i have h copies on the output so my load would be 9 plus 5 hc my resistances are r by 3 r by 3. hello yes so what will be my delay over here now so tdr propagation delay for rising what what is the rising eye condition one of the n mosses should be off and two of the p monster should be off that will give me the worst delay am i right so one of the p mosses was on and i could get the ppdr as nine plus five hrc because this is the only path are you with me yes sir now what about the falling delay so following delay i have here these two capacitors also into picture which need to be discharged before the output gets discharged we will apply the elmore's delay equation and we will see that the following delay is 12 plus 5 hrc what did i do i simply set this 3c from r by 3 then this 3c from 2r by 3 then this from r you see so answer i get is 12 plus 5 hrc so one thing that is evident is that in a nand gate even if i have sized it equivalent to an to a regular inverter the rise and fall delays will not be equal the rise the propagation delays for rise and fall will not be equal are we able to see this huh and uh what about the contamination delay or the pmos side it is very simple all the three p moses have to turn on simultaneously so the effective resistance would be r by 3 and this would be the fastest that my output would double are you able to see this friends i'm not a client okay so what about the falling contamination delay what happens there so falling contamination delay is your homework you estimate the following contamination delay the fastest delay that would get in contamination for the falling case what would you do we already discussed that for the two input nand gate for three input nand gate i'm giving it to you as homework so you don't need to submit that homework but just do it just to get more clarity for yourself so what how would you calculate the contamination delay for falling so if the um two transistors below i mean if they are already been discharged yes so these capacitances they will already be out of picture and then only this will have to discharge okay you will see it will come to be something similar only okay so before we prove it can we uh can we go back to when we derive the uh rc modulus of pmos and nmos um okay yeah yeah yeah exactly so i mean can you just go over how we derive this okay forget about the term k over here okay so if i have a if i have mosfet and i say it is on what all capacitances and resistances do i have i have a cd i have a cg i have a r on and i have a cs yes so a right now the switch the switch is the mos switch now if the gate is at zero the nmos will not conduct so this is an open connection then okay the drain and the source are not connected that's all answers cd and css are basically diffusion capacitances conclusion plus overlap plus all that yes the all that we discussed yeah but so if you are including the overlap i mean you mean gate to drain and gate resource so what is the gate capacitance you are facing away get capacious come we did all that master passion for cheese now so everything oh sir but we have included that in for our cd and cs now that um gate 2 source capacity but gate 2 inversion layer capacitance will be there now oh yeah of course i know so why did we cover all that so it might be sounding like a solid state devices but you realize this is all very relevant to us,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDntVpDkcec,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDntVpDkcec

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,wUHaLuQzSxg,uh what is called as uh you know logical effort the concept of logical efforts and this concept is is uh will help us to size devices gates and chains of devices chains of base mother you have a question yes sir i have a doubt in contamination delay that dust contamination really always affect only hold time or it may in some cases also affect setup times no contamination delay is uh is is fastest today so it will not usually have any bearing on the third time so but in some cases like in to input 90 only in in one case i was seeing that fall daily was increasing so i don't know if it was increasing i'm sorry performed fall delay so that is then the propagation delay contamination delay is always the shortest the smallest delay [Music] okay this is the fastest delay that is the definition of contamination if there is a faster delay then that is the contamination delay okay so anything slower than that will be propagation yeah will be a part of propagation today okay [Music] okay yeah so this method is called logical effort and as i mentioned you know in the last class also that we would want to size circuits get a feel of the circuit and do stuff with that even without doing the first simulation so logical effort will help us do back of the envelope sizing of circuits so what did we do in the last class we did back with another calculations for estimating the delays we did not do any simulation but we could say okay this delay is six units this delay is four units and so on you were able to say that yes sir so with logical effort what we are trying to say is with logical effort we are saying that i will similarly be able to do some circuit sizing without even running one simulation okay so let us say this is an inverter chain if the load capacitance is given what would be the minimum number of stages or what how many stages do i need to have minimum minimum delay and what should be the size of my inverters if we have to answer this question that is when logical effort comes into picture is the question player is the objective of this session clear so in the previous classes we have discussed that given the sizing and everything what will be the backend calculation of the delay now we are doing the exact opposite of that yes because as a circuit designer you need to do both yeah okay okay okay okay so sir yes how will the delays uh decrease or increase i'm like i think it they should increase if we increase the number of stages right so let us see okay okay so uh the first step that we need to do is we need to express delays in process independent units because i don't want to now talk about what would happen in 65 nanometer what would happen in 40 nanometer or 80 nanometer or 180 nanometers i want to come up with a design method which is process independent technology independent and to do that what we do is we say that okay let us talk of a unit d which is basically the absolute value of delay divided by tau and this tau is equal to 3 rc y3 rc y3 rc uh time delay of importer yeah so delay of an inverter without any fan out or in a different way if the inverter was ideal and had no self-loading then the delay with one panel are you with me so we are not considering that two c and c of the uh we will see we will i'm not saying we're not considering i am saying let us represent delays in the standard format where we do d by the absolute by tau and tau is equal to 3 rc we just take i'm not saying we are ignoring anything okay okay did i say i'm ignoring anything no no sir not yet clear three rc is there so you know there are some significance of three rc that is why we are using crc then we say that delay has two components f and p f component represents effort delay which is stage effort that my how big is the output okay and it again has two components one is logical effort so abby definitions so don't get bogged down by so many new terms that you are getting to here just now uh you will have time to absorb them okay so effort delay s is a multiplication of logical effort and electrical effort so logical effort is a relative ability of a gate to deliver current what is it relative to it is related to an inverter so if it's a nand gate we will see how to calculate its logical effort electrical effort is very simple it simply is the ratio of output resist output capacitance with the input capacitance it is also called as fan out okay so three new terms on this particular slide effort delay logical effort and electrical effort okay and then there is parasitic delay this represents the delay of a gate when there was no load so how much would this delay be for an inverter hello there is three rc yes this delay parasitic delay will be three rc so d equal to the so d absolute will be three rc so d equal to be one for an inverter are you able to see this does that mean three rc means one unit delay yes okay okay okay so with these definitions let us see how to estimate the value of g and h2 h2 g and other stuff so that we can overall get the value of total delay in any system so what we did was we plotted the delays offered to input nand and an inverter for uh different electrical effort and these were the graphs that we received what we see is that g for a nand is about four by three parasitic is two and the d is four by three h plus two whereas for the inverter g resolve is one because everything is related to an inverter parasitic delay we found to be one unit so the delay would be h plus one h would be the fan out so how did we get g equal to four by three any ideas because then you will be able to answer the question on nordic no what would be the same thing for not to sir can you just just briefly explain this g and h and were able to distinguish between them the g and h i'm getting h fan out sir is it the slope sir yes it is the slope but to the previous question h is fan out okay in very simple terms that is fan out which is also called as electrical effort in the logical effort terminology okay so the more number of so the more number of grades it would be driving the moon the electrical effect a bigger drive the more delay which is also intuitive yeah answer the g thing the b parameter yeah g is the uh is the ratio of uh or let us say in this case g is the slope of this line g is the logical effort how much extra effort do i need to get to put in in comparison to an inverter what do you mean by effort english me physics may what do we mean by effort so i mean there's some kind of force of the force i have to apply hannah yeah so how do i apply a force on a gate input on a on a gate which is a two input nand gate for example so you can repeat the question just just ask so how do i apply force on a two input nand gate so that it starts to give an output that i desire so we're charging its input so by charging its input capacitances so do you see that there could be some relation between the input capacitance of a two input nand gate and the input capacitance of an inverter so i didn't get the point of charging the input capacitances i mean we are just applying the input signal right huh does your input signal what does the input signal do what does the input signal do so we apply the gate to source voltage and then basically depending upon that the channel is formed and then if there is a capacitance here no yeah yes sir that charges this capacitance okay that is when this will go up now right the gate capacity you're talking about okay so now for an inverter what was the capacitance that you needed to charge so 3c 3c what is the capacitance that you will need to charge for this inverter this nand gate okay okay so we are taking the input signal strength to be out of the equation just the gates yes okay therefore that for the logical effort for uh uh two input nand is four by three okay like how much more it is required compared to the inverter okay okay how much more effort do i need to put to get the same result same response as an inverter would have given okay got it sir okay so what would it be for not to quickly how would you size an r2 what would be the size of the n masses bulla how would i size the nmos is here in the worst case how many nmos is in series so [Music] okay what about the pmos now 5x3 wonderful are all of you able to see this no sir right okay let's go into detail uh the logical effort is the ratio of the input capacitance of a gate to the input capacitance of an inverter delivering the same output current so for a nand gate the c cn is 4 so g is equal to 4 by 3 for a nor gate the cn is 5 therefore g is equal to 5 by 3. so there are different inputs or if the two inputs are there then you take any one input we talk only about a what is happening to it so we're not going to a complex gate i know there could be a complex gate which could appear like this a b and c so c would have different sizing than b so ecological effort let us look at symmetric gates only in the exam you may get complex gates you may want to propose questions of complex rates in your assignment but just to understand the concept let us start with simple symmetric dates what happens so first this four four and one one is clear this was the question is i lost in the beginning also sir yes so this sizings are done just to ensure that we'll have same equivalent resistance both for the rise and the fall time yeah right yes it's not with the delay that we achieved are on okay the but how is this related to same power i did not understand this so uh what is current across a mosfet okay it's voltage divided by our own okay yeah so you will get iron yes yes yes sir got it thank you okay so can i say the lower the logical effort the less will be the delay the lower the logical effort the lesser will be the delay yes because g becomes less so g into h is small yes so when we design do we keep for like more of nand gates in circuit because they are faster we don't know [Music] you would probably want to yes but if you need a nor functionality then you need an functionality so is this calculation for g clear all of you so yes i'm still quite a bit confused in the calculation of g calculation of g or sizing of the gate uh actually the sizing only sizing mecha confusion what is the confusion there what i am understanding is the resistance of both the nmos should be [Music] you have to look at it as in the worst case when only one nmos is on the delay of the nor gate should be equal to the delay of the inverter delaney is output current okay so how would you size the n masses then the same as the inverter yes sir the same applies for the pmos at the current should be same as in an inverter however there are two pmoses in series now so what do you need to do you need to halve the resistance yes sir to half the resistance you need to double the size up yes yes therefore the p mass of inverter should be doubled up therefore p mosses are sized at four okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUHaLuQzSxg,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUHaLuQzSxg

have time to absorb them okay so effort delay s is a multiplication of logical effort and electrical effort so logical effort is a relative ability of a gate to deliver current what is it relative to it is related to an inverter so if it's a nand gate we will see how to calculate its logical effort electrical effort is very simple it simply is the ratio of output resist output capacitance with the input capacitance it is also called as fan out okay so three new terms on this particular slide effort delay logical effort and electrical effort okay and then there is parasitic delay this represents the delay of a gate when there was no load so how much would this delay be for an inverter hello there is three rc yes this delay parasitic delay will be three rc so d equal to the so d absolute will be three rc so d equal to be one for an inverter are you able to see this does that mean three rc means one unit delay yes okay okay okay so with these definitions let us see how to estimate the value of g and h2 h2 g and other stuff so that we can overall get the value of total delay in any system so what we did was we plotted the delays offered to input nand and an inverter for uh different electrical effort and these were the graphs that we received what we see is that g for a nand is about four by three parasitic is two and the d is four by three h plus two whereas for the inverter g resolve is one because everything is related to an inverter parasitic delay we found to be one unit so the delay would be h plus one h would be the fan out so how did we get g equal to four by three any ideas because then you will be able to answer the question on nordic no what would be the same thing for not to sir can you just just briefly explain this g and h and were able to distinguish between them the g and h i'm getting h fan out sir is it the slope sir yes it is the slope but to the previous question h is fan out okay in very simple terms that is fan out which is also called as electrical effort in the logical effort terminology okay so the more number of so the more number of grades it would be driving the moon the electrical effect a bigger drive the more delay which is also intuitive yeah answer the g thing the b parameter yeah g is the uh is the ratio of uh or let us say in this case g is the slope of this line g is the logical effort how much extra effort do i need to get to put in in comparison to an inverter what do you mean by effort english me physics may what do we mean by effort so i mean there's some kind of force of the force i have to apply hannah yeah so how do i apply a force on a gate input on a on a gate which is a two input nand gate for example so you can repeat the question just just ask so how do i apply force on a two input nand gate so that it starts to give an output that i desire so we're charging its input so by charging its input capacitances so do you see that there could be some relation between the input capacitance of a two input nand gate and the input capacitance of an inverter so i didn't get the point of charging the input capacitances i mean we are just applying the input signal right huh does your input signal what does the input signal do what does the input signal do so we apply the gate to source voltage and then basically depending upon that the channel is formed and then if there is a capacitance here no yeah yes sir that charges this capacitance okay that is when this will go up now right the gate capacity you're talking about okay so now for an inverter what was the capacitance that you needed to charge so 3c 3c what is the capacitance that you will need to charge for this inverter this nand gate okay okay so we are taking the input signal strength to be out of the equation just the gates yes okay therefore that for the logical effort for uh uh two input nand is four by three okay like how much more it is required compared to the inverter okay okay how much more effort do i need to put to get the same result same response as an inverter would have given okay got it sir okay so what would it be for not to quickly how would you size an r2 what would be the size of the n masses bulla how would i size the nmos is here in the worst case how many nmos is in series so [Music] okay what about the pmos now 5x3 wonderful are all of you able to see this no sir right okay let's go into detail uh the logical effort is the ratio of the input capacitance of a gate to the input capacitance of an inverter delivering the same output current so for a nand gate the c cn is 4 so g is equal to 4 by 3 for a nor gate the cn is 5 therefore g is equal to 5 by 3. so there are different inputs or if the two inputs are there then you take any one input we talk only about a what is happening to it so we're not going to a complex gate i know there could be a complex gate which could appear like this a b and c so c would have different sizing than b so ecological effort let us look at symmetric gates only in the exam you may get complex gates you may want to propose questions of complex rates in your assignment but just to understand the concept let us start with simple symmetric dates what happens so first this four four and one one is clear this was the question is i lost in the beginning also sir yes so this sizings are done just to ensure that we'll have same equivalent resistance both for the rise and the fall time yeah right yes it's not with the delay that we achieved are on okay the but how is this related to same power i did not understand this so uh what is current across a mosfet okay it's voltage divided by our own okay yeah so you will get iron yes yes yes sir got it thank you okay so can i say the lower the logical effort the less will be the delay the lower the logical effort the lesser will be the delay yes because g becomes less so g into h is small yes so when we design do we keep for like more of nand gates in circuit because they are faster we don't know [Music] you would probably want to yes but if you need a nor functionality then you need an functionality so is this calculation for g clear all of you so yes i'm still quite a bit confused in the calculation of g calculation of g or sizing of the gate uh actually the sizing only sizing mecha confusion what is the confusion there what i am understanding is the resistance of both the nmos should be [Music] you have to look at it as in the worst case when only one nmos is on the delay of the nor gate should be equal to the delay of the inverter delaney is output current okay so how would you size the n masses then the same as the inverter yes sir the same applies for the pmos at the current should be same as in an inverter however there are two pmoses in series now so what do you need to do you need to halve the resistance yes sir to half the resistance you need to double the size up yes yes therefore the p mass of inverter should be doubled up therefore p mosses are sized at four okay"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,GKW7auPWGbA,okay so okay anything else okay so now now that we know this we can actually find out the uh logical effort for various gates you can actually also come to standard formulae that for a nor gate will be 2 n plus 1 by 3 for a nand gate it will be n plus 2 where n is the number of inputs and so on so and as we said in complex gates there could be different logical effort for different inputs so can you benefit from it if at all put your designer hat and tell me if there are if you're using a xor 3 let us say we are using this particular gate how would you like can you benefit from the fact that some inputs have lower logical effort others have larger logical effort so maybe for inputs that don't switch much we can keep them with gates with less logical effect so those that do not switch much you will put them on with uh more logical effort larger logical effort okay so then that will save power interesting very interesting um anything about delays yes larger the logical effort lesser the opposite i think yeah so the gate which has the lesser logical effort on that gate you will apply those signals which arrive late yes so uh that's there as a differential logical effort is not necessarily a bad thing you can also make some good use of it see something like now when life throws lemons at you you better make lemonade so that's what you can also do over here so uh you can now given any gate you will be able to estimate the logical effort there you all just need to do is do the sizing correctly and you will be able to do it now what about parasitic delay what would you tell about panacetic delay over here so these parasitic dnas are gate to source and i mean gate to body and these types of diseases yes these types of capacitances it depends on number of inputs yes it is actually dependent on number of inputs why because you we just saw that the overall sizing of my gates is also dependent on number of inputs so the parasitics that i will possibly observe in my layout will also be dependent on number of inputs so simply we say as many inputs as many you know uh as much of the inverter then for tristate and mux uh the inputs go to two gates and or more gates and therefore we said okay it is 2n okay so now now that we know how to find estimate the delay of an inverter can you estimate the frequency of an end stage ring oscillator what would be the logical effort over here huh in this case for the end stage inverter what would be the logical effort three and uh logical effort these are inverters only now so it has to be one yes another z equal to one it is all inverters what is the electrical effort electrical effort is the fan out how many inverters is one is any inverter connected to the output um your first inverter the output of the first inverter has a nine capacitors capacitances and parallels so we can say n so it is c out over c n yes c out of the first inverter is that equal to cn um no so it's uh because of the other you're also looking at the uh input capacitances of the other inverters right that is coming in the output yeah see parasitics due to self-loading something we are adding later okay the load that this inverter is seeing is that equal to the load that this inverter is showing to its driver oh yes so electrical effort is also one parasitic delay is inverter for one so what is the stage delay stage delay is two are you able to see this questions so so here the electrical effort is one so but like the rc out here is basically the cd diffusion one and it with the in that scene will be the gate oh no so c diffusion we are already putting in the parasitic delay okay then we talk of electrical effort we only talk of the gate gate load of the uh next stage over here okay and the c insert what then is the c and basically i mean see the gate the c n is the gate capacitance of this stage of the of the of the subsequent stage of the stage so see in so for any inverter see for any inverter cn is the capacitance that it shows to the previous state so for this inverter there is a capacitance over here this will be called as its cn and the capacitance over here will be called as c out okay is it going to be the same okay so i mean the c out of one gate is the scene of another gate okay okay so so for the first inverter the gate capacitance of the second inverter will be the c out yes okay and the scene will be its own gate input okay okay so now okay are you is this up till stage delay part player to all of you see we already saw for an inverter we already saw that for an inverter if we talked of it in terms of rcs so there was 2c up there and 1c down here you already saw that anna yeah yeah okay so that is equal to 1d so and in the case of electrical delay can't we just say the fan out of every inverter is one so now what will be the frequency so i still don't get logical effect logical effort of an inverter is one so but we are cascading so we mean so one guys for any inverter for any stage how much effort does the previous stage need to apply in comparison to an inverter to get the same output as an inverter would give that is the definition so if you already have inverters then it is the same effort now okay so we we are looking at only one invert with this entire stage this is the first first we are arriving at the calculation for one stage delay once we have the calculation for one stage delay then we can find the calculation for n stages so you simply multiply it by n okay and just this stage what is this stage space division yeah so what is that this is gh plus p that was the formula okay yes so now what is that what is the frequency now there is no single stage frequency ui we only only have gh pd over here so what is the frequency at which this ring oscillator will oscillate is it 1 by d for 1 by nd 1 by nd no anyone asking or telling so what is the total delay of this inverter chain sir for one stage the delay is uh uh so uh it should it has to be one by two and and now start being with us okay what is the ring oscillator for an ancient oscillator will env even or odd events if you have an even number of stages will it ever oscillate it has to be hard it has to be odd so let us say i gave a input rising input over here so after these end stages what will i get as my input after this end delays the input would finally fall yes sir then after those stages again the input would again go up so what is the clock period then true ending but i have to go through these n stages twice and each each stage consumes a delay of d so since d is equal to 4 we say 4n hmm is this part clear yes sir yes sir so uh and now for a given technology if you know what is the value of d in the sense what is the value of rc what is the value of tau and you have an end stage oscillator can you estimate the frequency yes sir so let us say i have to make a like to make a oscillator of let us say 200 megahertz for a 0.6 micron technology you can easily estimate how many stitches you would need in the ring oscillator now you can do that if i know that for 0.5 4.6 micron technology the delay is 60 picoseconds let us say tau is equal to 60 picoseconds we can do it now yes sir so we've not done even a single simulation we just uses the we just used the information of tau from the technology and i'm able to design this entire chain an entire oscillator are you able to see the beauty of this method not a single simulation but i can estimate okay for this one i will need around 31 status probably 29 or 33 but i am right there somewhere sir so why i'm having a factor of doing denominator just missing out on that so because there are odd status in this chain yes sir yeah so when the input is rising the next time the input will come it will be falling so once an input traverses through all of this and it comes back it will be falling odd enough status yes so yeah yeah so i will have to traverse through this stage all over again to get the rising signal again okay okay all right so n over here n over here yeah okay got it okay okay so what about this now can we estimate the delay now if i say that every inverter is driving four equivalently size inverters what is my delay so h will be four here okay what is the logical effort so for logical effort so one one inverter yeah electrical effort is four hq set four okay pacific delay so one no no one one page delays cheers okay so if i know the technology the tau for a given technology i can immediately estimate the delay there are you able to see this yes now sir so just just to clarify one thing so this parasitic delay uh when i'm looking at the electrical effort that is basically modeling all the outputs that my basically the which is the my stage which is driving and when i'm looking at the parasitic delay i'm looking at the stage itself like which is going to be the driver basically yes right okay yes

going to be the same okay so i mean the c out of one gate is the scene of another gate okay okay so so for the first inverter the gate capacitance of the second inverter will be the c out yes okay and the scene will be its own gate input okay okay so now okay are you is this up till stage delay part player to all of you see we already saw for an inverter we already saw that for an inverter if we talked of it in terms of rcs so there was 2c up there and 1c down here you already saw that anna yeah yeah okay so that is equal to 1d so and in the case of electrical delay can't we just say the fan out of every inverter is one so now what will be the frequency so i still don't get logical effect logical effort of an inverter is one so but we are cascading so we mean so one guys for any inverter for any stage how much effort does the previous stage need to apply in comparison to an inverter to get the same output as an inverter would give that is the definition so if you already have inverters then it is the same effort now okay so we we are looking at only one invert with this entire stage this is the first first we are arriving at the calculation for one stage delay once we have

ring oscillator will oscillate is it 1 by d for 1 by nd 1 by nd no anyone asking or telling so what is the total delay of this inverter chain sir for one stage the delay is uh uh so uh it should it has to be one by two and and now start being with us okay what is the ring oscillator for an ancient oscillator will env even or odd events if you have an even number of stages will it ever oscillate it has to be hard it has to be odd so let us say i gave a input rising input over here so after these end stages what will i get as my input after this end delays the input would finally fall yes sir

driving four equivalently size inverters what is my delay so h will be four here okay what is the logical effort so for logical effort so one one inverter yeah electrical effort is four hq set four okay pacific delay so one no no one one page delays cheers okay so if i know the technology the tau for a given technology i can immediately estimate the delay there are you able to see this yes now sir so just just to clarify one thing so this parasitic delay uh when i'm looking at the electrical effort that is basically modeling all the outputs that my basically the which is the my stage which is driving and when i'm looking at the parasitic delay i'm looking at the stage itself like which is going to be the driver basically yes right okay yes okay"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,RioleqvE7IM,so we will only look at driver when we are calculating parasitically i'm sorry so we will only be looking at the driver when calculating parasitic damage yeah the gate the gate for which we are calculating the delay we will only look at that we'll not look at the load okay no matter load may even have a lot of parasitic delay at its input yeah like over here we have four inverters as load and we would as well have ten inverters as low it will still take parasitic delay as one okay so because only one inverter is triggered yeah because it is the property of the driver the self loading of the driver there okay so now this is avid we were just looking at one stage delay now what happens if we have a complex path see typically we will not have only inverters capacitance we typically have multiple logics and multiple things coming into picture so in that case we talk about path logical effort which is multiplication of all the incumbent logical efforts path electrical effort which is c out final upon c in which make a doesn't matter okay and then overall path effort would be a multiplication of path efforts of each of these so which would appear to be something like multiplication of gh let us take this example itself i ask you to help me with sizing these nor gates and nand gates there so find the value of x y and z let us say so what do we do keep that question in mind we will just come to it can we probably write f is equal to g h is equal to g h but there is a small catch when there is a branch then you cannot really do that look at it over here g is 1 on this particular path f is 18 so gh is equal to 18. now let us calculate the h h1 and then h2 so what is h1 2 h1 is 2 just so fan out is 2 what about the size it's a 3 okay so it should be 6 then 6. huh and what about h2 6 h2 is also 6 why because 90 by 15 this is 90 and it has it has a gate load of 15. uh so what we say actual main capital f is equal to multiplication of g and the g's and h is so g1 g2 h1 h2 actual mate is equal to 36 but dh was only 18 so there is the factor of 2 where does this 2 come from two branches yes now over here this two can be said as two branches but if these branches were of different sizes we would not be able to put it as branches but if the two things are same size then we say that it is equal to gbh in reality we have to do it something like this branching effort is calculated by c on path plus c of path by c on path so i mean the f here is the stage delay equivalent of like multiple gates so by why we are not incorporating that the parasitic component here itself is a logical and electrical thing why not just can you go to the previous slide friends this is important concept i know you are yourself going to propose questions from this concept because this is full of numericals so it should be very very clear to you so can you just uh please explain the h part the 18 i mean 98 is coming up yeah because we saw that c out was 90 and cn was five so if you overall look at h for the path in which we want to measure the delay that h is 18 okay so we are taking the only the total like uh capacitance at the end of the path and at the input of the path that is what h meant in the in the previous slide what did we say in the still previous slide we had said that that is equal to ch of output on upon cn path that was what the definition of h was so that is what we did yeah so somebody's like so but like here we have like two edges two which right yes answer what is h1 h2 is denoting small h1 h2 h1 is a fan out for this stage h2 is the fan out for the second stage support when this input is driving two loads then how can we guarantee that uh path this path which is being highlighted its delay will not be affected at all by the uh the other part the above that is what we are finally concluding okay okay so that that is where the difference is that is what we are concluding we are not saying anything else sir okay sir but we can say that it won't be affected by the load that the other part is trying yeah because that would like if if this 15 was driving a load of let us say 180 i would still have this delay so sir yeah because i'm not bothered by h3 over here okay the h will change you will not i'm sorry uh the value of h would change the capital uh the capital h for the other but the g would not change the capital h will still be the same definition that is the definition of h okay yes we're just talking about is f equal to g x the question was is s equal to gh that was the question we said no we said there has to be another component which is related to branching in there we are answering only that question we're not saying h is calculated wrong no that was the definition of h please understood so and we are trying to calculate the delay eventually women calculate delay from all these things so if we apply elmore's uh almost delay then this above h3 will also come into picture for calculating delay from h1 to s2 so that is where that is where we're talking about off paths also paths which are not really under consideration okay that is why exactly that is the reason i am so happy that you are able to see that effect that is the nature of delay and because it has to come therefore this component of b which is a multiplication of all bis should also be brought into picture okay okay so yeah so i mean the h was calculated to be 18 so but we have two parts so shouldn't we have done the twice multiplication there itself i mean i wanted to find the delay of this path only okay i wanted to find the delay of this path so i will look at the output delay that this path has and then put the layer at this path i'm not bothered about this part for calculation of h okay so even if you're trying to consider this part the off path is coming into picture just like an elmore's delay yeah so but like uh okay right right if it is connected then it will be basically charging will load now the odd path will also load you have to take them into account okay but this definition doesn't take into account this h1 okay capital h is only c out by c n the basic definition what is the fan out what is c out by c n that's the thing so therefore we need to bring in this component of b and what we do understand is that bh will finally mean h1 into h2 into h3 into whatever h would not be able to that to be for this to be equal this has to be equal to b h so just can we just move again to the previous slide so h1 ms2 okay okay got it sir got it okay uh sir i have a doubt in the same slide can we can we go back so here in the calculation of h we have considered c in as 5 whereas c out as 90 that's that's not a right now because for an inverter at the input we would have three rc no no no wait i have i have five times the size of a regular inverter what do you do yes sir that time it should be five into three hours but if we consider the output at the output of this h2 we'll have 15 into 6 rc which is same as 90 whereas at the input we have uh 3 into 5 rc which has to be 15 so it has to be 90 divided by 15 so 90 is a capacitive load i have put there i'm not even talking about self-loading here yet i have put a wire load there which has a capacitance of 90. shouldn't we consider the self-loading also in this case in the beginning as of now we are not doing it we will do that don't worry okay yeah so i'm happy all of you are noticing that to be parasitic we'll do something about that also don't worry but yeah at least logical effort and electrical effort is that part clear yes sir there is a logical effort which will simply get multiplied electrical effort which will also get multiplied but that multiplication is not equal to h that multiplication is equal to b into h yes yes sir raghav you have a question it's a good criteria i just okay so now we understand that overall delay in a path is the sum of all the all the basic delays then we also define that the parasitic delays of all the stages will simply add up see we are adding parasitic delay with the capacities all the delays of all the parasitic delays will simply add up to finally give me a pass delay which is ds plus p okay if i want to find now the smallest uh or what is the optimal number of stages that i need to have to get the minimum delay we need to see that each delay has the same effort so if there are n stages and the total effort is gi into hi then what is it that i am looking at to have the minimum total delay that is an optimization problem you will see that each stage should have a delay equal to g i h i is equal to capital f total delay raised to power 1 by n so each stage is having equal load in a way okay therefore we can now estimate the minimum delay of an n stage path which is n into f raised to pi one by n plus p question so i mean here we are basically ignoring the fact what each stage is just considering it to be a stage and that kind of distraction yeah saying if it was a nand gate you size it such that its delay is also the same as any other stage if it's a nor gate size it such that its delay is also equal to any other gate like s also one by n yes you remember the first first example that we did that i showed you we did not solve it yet we want to solve it now yes so we say that optimal solution is when each stage bears the equal burden that is the best solution that is when the delay will be the minimum so how would the gates be sized if i know what is my appropriate stage delay i know what my g and h is so see out by seeing i know okay so i know that the gate type i know so i know what g is i now need to decide about c out and c n are you able to see that yes sir if i fix my c out then c in will be represented represented by this formula do you have any collateral okay okay optimal stage delay so for minimum delay then i would be able to estimate c in if i know what c out is huh if i know c n then i can also know what the sizing of my different devices so just a quick question here so if i know so uh depending upon the type of gate i would be looking at i would get the g because that would be complete so but once i get the g i get the same also right why because because i know the sizing based upon when i know the g i know okay this kind of no no no no wait there is an inverter just 5 there was another inverter just 15 how would you know how would you know kihapi reached my fifteen iii at twenty ayah g only tells this g is equal to one but to get the sizing of five i need some more information okay okay so like g is not related to sizing it's like g is only uh logical effort so but like uh so if say a size of an inverter size say five and better size one port will have the same g i mean this all is not descending to rise yes if it is an inverter whether it is size five or whether it is size 1 the g is equal to 1 because it's an inverter that's the topology of the gate that's the property of the gate the size is another property of the gate which could be varying g remains constant foreign effort compared to that inverter so a more bigger gate would be requiring more kind of what even if it is inverter but then for same size inverter let us put it like this but so like you just said now like five or one we will characterize the g as one so that is none g is equal to 1 for for an inverter of size 5 how would i size this particular gate differently so that i get the same current as an inverter of size 5. is equal to one okay right okay so why are we going backwards like we know the c out and available we want a desired c out so like this we should go now uh this looks simple but it is not as simple you will see that there will be chains there will be paths in which there are many gates which are simply there to increase the drive strength we'll come to them in a little while okay okay okay so for now let us just say that output we know is fixed output we always know is fixed now therefore going backwards is easy enough so you're designing some chain to drive an output load now so the output we know and now we go backwards mother you had a question except please go to the prehistoric [Music] uh effort logical and electrical effort mixed of the entire chain capital f small f so f prime that is the optimal stage effort of delay would also include a parasitic component so we're not really talking about delays we're talking about effort and so what does optimal effort mean optimal effort means uh effort such that i will get the minimum delay finally so this f prime is equal to f capital f raised to the power 1 by n is the solution of an optimization problem so you give it to a usf solver or do whatever you will realize that in any system if there are multiple parts contributing to a total delay then each part should have equivalent delay or you know normalized delay to be equivalent or equal to have the minimum delay of the entire system that is what the result says you want to go to the calculations you can i'm not going to them in the class so we know the step or the how do we get this this s equal to f raised to pi 1 by n so this capital f how did we get capital f yes all this what was this effort are you able to see this yes and that was for uh for different types for different difference smallers yeah anything okay and now we are saying that we will we raise it to power one by n to get the optimal optimal stage effort okay so now these stage will have the same logical yeah okay so yes uh serpent branching occurs uh so the stage uh the the fan out is two so both the stages should be two and three or four will be considered like if they're in pad those are parallel so they would be so if they're in parallel they will be considered as branches you will bring in this branch well offender i meant it one by n and in the end would they add one more plus one or they would n would remain same the branching let us see okay so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RioleqvE7IM,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RioleqvE7IM
Transcript: so we will only look at driver when we are calculating parasitically i'm sorry so we will only be looking at the driver when calculating parasitic damage yeah the gate the gate for which we are calculating the delay we will only look at that we'll not look at the load okay no matter load may even have a lot of parasitic delay at its input yeah like over here we have four inverters as load and we would as well have ten inverters as low it will still take parasitic delay as one okay so because only one inverter is triggered yeah because it is the property of the driver the self loading of the driver there okay so now this is avid we were just looking at one stage delay now what happens if we have a complex path see typically we will not have only inverters capacitance we typically have multiple logics and multiple things coming into picture so in that case we talk about path logical effort which is multiplication of all the incumbent logical efforts path electrical effort which is c out final upon c in which make a doesn't matter okay and then overall path effort would be a multiplication of path efforts of each of these so which would appear to be something like multiplication of gh let us take this example itself i ask you to help me with sizing these nor gates and nand gates there so find the value of x y and z let us say so what do we do keep that question in mind we will just come to it can we probably write f is equal to g h is equal to g h but there is a small catch when there is a branch then you cannot really do that look at it over here g is 1 on this particular path f is 18 so gh is equal to 18. now let us calculate the h h1 and then h2 so what is h1 2 h1 is 2 just so fan out is 2 what about the size it's a 3 okay so it should be 6 then 6. huh and what about h2 6 h2 is also 6 why because 90 by 15 this is 90 and it has it has a gate load of 15. uh so what we say actual main capital f is equal to multiplication of g and the g's and h is so g1 g2 h1 h2 actual mate is equal to 36 but dh was only 18 so there is the factor of 2 where does this 2 come from two branches yes now over here this two can be said as two branches but if these branches were of different sizes we would not be able to put it as branches but if the two things are same size then we say that it is equal to gbh in reality we have to do it something like this branching effort is calculated by c on path plus c of path by c on path so i mean the f here is the stage delay equivalent of like multiple gates so by why we are not incorporating that the parasitic component here itself is a logical and electrical thing why not just can you go to the previous slide friends this is important concept i know you are yourself going to propose questions from this concept because this is full of numericals so it should be very very clear to you so can you just uh please explain the h part the 18 i mean 98 is coming up yeah because we saw that c out was 90 and cn was five so if you overall look at h for the path in which we want to measure the delay that h is 18 okay so we are taking the only the total like uh capacitance at the end of the path and at the input of the path that is what h meant in the in the previous slide what did we say in the still previous slide we had said that that is equal to ch of output on upon cn path that was what the definition of h was so that is what we did yeah so somebody's like so but like here we have like two edges two which right yes answer what is h1 h2 is denoting small h1 h2 h1 is a fan out for this stage h2 is the fan out for the second stage support when this input is driving two loads then how can we guarantee that uh path this path which is being highlighted its delay will not be affected at all by the uh the other part the above that is what we are finally concluding okay okay so that that is where the difference is that is what we are concluding we are not saying anything else sir okay sir but we can say that it won't be affected by the load that the other part is trying yeah because that would like if if this 15 was driving a load of let us say 180 i would still have this delay so sir yeah because i'm not bothered by h3 over here okay the h will change you will not i'm sorry uh the value of h would change the capital uh the capital h for the other but the g would not change the capital h will still be the same definition that is the definition of h okay yes we're just talking about is f equal to g x the question was is s equal to gh that was the question we said no we said there has to be another component which is related to branching in there we are answering only that question we're not saying h is calculated wrong no that was the definition of h please understood so and we are trying to calculate the delay eventually women calculate delay from all these things so if we apply elmore's uh almost delay then this above h3 will also come into picture for calculating delay from h1 to s2 so that is where that is where we're talking about off paths also paths which are not really under consideration okay that is why exactly that is the reason i am so happy that you are able to see that effect that is the nature of delay and because it has to come therefore this component of b which is a multiplication of all bis should also be brought into picture okay okay so yeah so i mean the h was calculated to be 18 so but we have two parts so shouldn't we have done the twice multiplication there itself i mean i wanted to find the delay of this path only okay i wanted to find the delay of this path so i will look at the output delay that this path has and then put the layer at this path i'm not bothered about this part for calculation of h okay so even if you're trying to consider this part the off path is coming into picture just like an elmore's delay yeah so but like uh okay right right if it is connected then it will be basically charging will load now the odd path will also load you have to take them into account okay but this definition doesn't take into account this h1 okay capital h is only c out by c n the basic definition what is the fan out what is c out by c n that's the thing so therefore we need to bring in this component of b and what we do understand is that bh will finally mean h1 into h2 into h3 into whatever h would not be able to that to be for this to be equal this has to be equal to b h so just can we just move again to the previous slide so h1 ms2 okay okay got it sir got it okay uh sir i have a doubt in the same slide can we can we go back so here in the calculation of h we have considered c in as 5 whereas c out as 90 that's that's not a right now because for an inverter at the input we would have three rc no no no wait i have i have five times the size of a regular inverter what do you do yes sir that time it should be five into three hours but if we consider the output at the output of this h2 we'll have 15 into 6 rc which is same as 90 whereas at the input we have uh 3 into 5 rc which has to be 15 so it has to be 90 divided by 15 so 90 is a capacitive load i have put there i'm not even talking about self-loading here yet i have put a wire load there which has a capacitance of 90. shouldn't we consider the self-loading also in this case in the beginning as of now we are not doing it we will do that don't worry okay yeah so i'm happy all of you are noticing that to be parasitic we'll do something about that also don't worry but yeah at least logical effort and electrical effort is that part clear yes sir there is a logical effort which will simply get multiplied electrical effort which will also get multiplied but that multiplication is not equal to h that multiplication is equal to b into h yes yes sir raghav you have a question it's a good criteria i just okay so now we understand that overall delay in a path is the sum of all the all the basic delays then we also define that the parasitic delays of all the stages will simply add up see we are adding parasitic delay with the capacities all the delays of all the parasitic delays will simply add up to finally give me a pass delay which is ds plus p okay if i want to find now the smallest uh or what is the optimal number of stages that i need to have to get the minimum delay we need to see that each delay has the same effort so if there are n stages and the total effort is gi into hi then what is it that i am looking at to have the minimum total delay that is an optimization problem you will see that each stage should have a delay equal to g i h i is equal to capital f total delay raised to power 1 by n so each stage is having equal load in a way okay therefore we can now estimate the minimum delay of an n stage path which is n into f raised to pi one by n plus p question so i mean here we are basically ignoring the fact what each stage is just considering it to be a stage and that kind of distraction yeah saying if it was a nand gate you size it such that its delay is also the same as any other stage if it's a nor gate size it such that its delay is also equal to any other gate like s also one by n yes you remember the first first example that we did that i showed you we did not solve it yet we want to solve it now yes so we say that optimal solution is when each stage bears the equal burden that is the best solution that is when the delay will be the minimum so how would the gates be sized if i know what is my appropriate stage delay i know what my g and h is so see out by seeing i know okay so i know that the gate type i know so i know what g is i now need to decide about c out and c n are you able to see that yes sir if i fix my c out then c in will be represented represented by this formula do you have any collateral okay okay optimal stage delay so for minimum delay then i would be able to estimate c in if i know what c out is huh if i know c n then i can also know what the sizing of my different devices so just a quick question here so if i know so uh depending upon the type of gate i would be looking at i would get the g because that would be complete so but once i get the g i get the same also right why because because i know the sizing based upon when i know the g i know okay this kind of no no no no wait there is an inverter just 5 there was another inverter just 15 how would you know how would you know kihapi reached my fifteen iii at twenty ayah g only tells this g is equal to one but to get the sizing of five i need some more information okay okay so like g is not related to sizing it's like g is only uh logical effort so but like uh so if say a size of an inverter size say five and better size one port will have the same g i mean this all is not descending to rise yes if it is an inverter whether it is size five or whether it is size 1 the g is equal to 1 because it's an inverter that's the topology of the gate that's the property of the gate the size is another property of the gate which could be varying g remains constant foreign effort compared to that inverter so a more bigger gate would be requiring more kind of what even if it is inverter but then for same size inverter let us put it like this but so like you just said now like five or one we will characterize the g as one so that is none g is equal to 1 for for an inverter of size 5 how would i size this particular gate differently so that i get the same current as an inverter of size 5. is equal to one okay right okay so why are we going backwards like we know the c out and available we want a desired c out so like this we should go now uh this looks simple but it is not as simple you will see that there will be chains there will be paths in which there are many gates which are simply there to increase the drive strength we'll come to them in a little while okay okay okay so for now let us just say that output we know is fixed output we always know is fixed now therefore going backwards is easy enough so you're designing some chain to drive an output load now so the output we know and now we go backwards mother you had a question except please go to the prehistoric [Music] uh effort logical and electrical effort mixed of the entire chain capital f small f so f prime that is the optimal stage effort of delay would also include a parasitic component so we're not really talking about delays we're talking about effort and so what does optimal effort mean optimal effort means uh effort such that i will get the minimum delay finally so this f prime is equal to f capital f raised to the power 1 by n is the solution of an optimization problem so you give it to a usf solver or do whatever you will realize that in any system if there are multiple parts contributing to a total delay then each part should have equivalent delay or you know normalized delay to be equivalent or equal to have the minimum delay of the entire system that is what the result says you want to go to the calculations you can i'm not going to them in the class so we know the step or the how do we get this this s equal to f raised to pi 1 by n so this capital f how did we get capital f yes all this what was this effort are you able to see this yes and that was for uh for different types for different difference smallers yeah anything okay and now we are saying that we will we raise it to power one by n to get the optimal optimal stage effort okay so now these stage will have the same logical yeah okay so yes uh serpent branching occurs uh so the stage uh the the fan out is two so both the stages should be two and three or four will be considered like if they're in pad those are parallel so they would be so if they're in parallel they will be considered as branches you will bring in this branch well offender i meant it one by n and in the end would they add one more plus one or they would n would remain same the branching let us see okay so"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,Cdk33854gqQ,uh are you a b are you able to see that it is equally easy going backwards because c out we know is fixed so from the last stage we go backward and we do the sizing and then we simply check that is it meeting the input capacitance check or not so let us take the same example that i had shown flashed earlier so what is the effective fanout h for this system five five great sorry uh what is the effective g for this system 5 by 3 whole square 25 by 9 25 by 9. what will be capital f yes so capital f will be 125 by nine i know the number of stages is four so i will do the fourth root of 13.9 i will get f equal to 1.93 and i will essentially get all the sizes abc in my system are you able to see this sir yes sir i have a doubt sir so while we were doing uh previously we were doing f power one by and right sir so that means that uh that's the maximum delay which we can have in a stage but uh you you said that that's the minimum delay which we can have like it's mentioned in the previous slide no so capital f is the total path effort yes i want to design this path to have minimum delay you're getting confused between effort and delay now effort of each stage should be equal to get the minimum delay okay therefore i do fourth root of s there are four stages over here and i get f as one point nine three yes i understood uh yeah understood okay so now based on this because f is 1.93 i will be able to calculate all the delay all the gate delays all the gate sizes okay so we can reduce that we just saw the output cap and then calculated the overall number and then distributed it at every stage and then designed it accordingly yeah we estimated the overall effort yes and said each stage will offer equal effort right okay okay so now based on this can you also estimate which of these eight input and gate configuration will be the best fastest do you think you will be able to do this you can size all of them you can also estimate what the total delay is and what is the total area can you do this hello so so here we will be calculating the capital f for each of the configurations and then comparing you will calculate capital s then you will divide it by the number of stages in the first a and b the status is 2 so you will find a square root to get the smallest in the in the case c there are four stages so you would find fourth root to get the smallest and you can size all the gates okay so but like if i want to compare which of which of these would be the fastest so then i would be competing with the capital f right and then choosing based upon capital then i will go okay okay now i need yes you can say capital f plus p you can find the total delay yes you can compare that way also but if you have to size even you can get an estimate of area that is what i am saying the logical effort technique also gives you an estimate of area of the system so what is the trade off area versus speed trade-off you are able to see here are you able to see that yeah yeah if i give more area then i get speed but at what cost of area am i getting that speed is it worth it or not you're able to get that yes yes so edge sir yes can you please move to the previous slide okay yeah the capital s for all of them is 1 by 10 capital f for h capital h would be same capital h would be no it will in fact it may not end up being same because uh uh or you can have a specification of capital h that my input capacitance has to be 1 and has to be 3c and output capacitance has to be something so then the delays would change okay okay and so forth yeah so can i ask right now yeah for the stages the first one has two stage the second has three stages am i right or it will be considered as two stages two sets only and the fourth has four stages yeah okay okay anna yes sir yes as i can calculate that the third option is uh we are getting the low values are in there so uh can we say that if the number of stages are more than our uh this value of delay would be less for something like that can we control something why do you want to jump to such such conclusions when the method to calculate the delay is so simple is the method not simple enough yes sir it's simple but but uh why why unnecessarily complicate your life arrived at this doubt because the uh the values for the first a and b figures for the same size i'm like when i get no right now is going to be a perfect engineer he wants to find shortcuts for everything i'm already giving you a shortcut i'm asking you not to do any simulation and i am able to tell you what the design should be you want a shortcut of that also no nothing yes no no no so let's know uh you know professor respection you must be taking course with them huh yes sir so he very famously says that a good engineer is a lazy person so he looks for shortcuts at all times so i'm not complaining i'm just saying you are going to be a good engineer because you're always continuously looking for shortcuts making life simpler but i would say if you run into deductions into deducing something based on just one example you are putting yourself at risk you should come to such conclusions only after you've seen variety of cases eight example basis but don't arrive at a conclusion yes example you just have one observation not a conclusion yes sir understood okay thank you you will see more examples you will see that what you just said is not valid so this is just one observation consider it as one observation don't jump to a conclusion conclusion you build over time uh sir i have a question sir yes sir in the c case so we have uh four stages suppose in the lower section instead of having a nor gate i have an or gate so at that point of time does it mean that we'll have five stages so how will you make an or gate so nor cascading with inverter so yeah if you if you make an r and then an inverter yes you will have five stairs done but in the uh uh in the above circuit we just have a target which is uh sure that path has just uh of course the technologies this method is agnostic of whatever gate we are talking about is it not yes sir if you have a or gate you will make a nod and then you will make an inverter so you will have those extra status there already so probably what you will end up doing is so if you want to maintain the same logic if you say i will put a or gate here then the next stage instead of being a nand would be a nor gate yes yes and we will not need this inverter so you're putting two inverters here then stages will be four right hanging so again you will have to look at the specific implementation and then do something like don't don't try to conclude yes be with the process if the method is clear then whatever gate i throw at you you should be able to solve it is it not yes seriously i want you to develop that capability yes understood so and why will all this all these things why are we not considering parasitic deals what if sizing some inverter increases by a certain table by too much i'm sorry so um by doing this method if we are not considering parasitic data still we find the optimal sizing so what if the due to optimal sizing my parasitic debris of some stage increases yeah so all those things would happen mother what we are looking at is we want the back of the envelope calculation method this you will finally realize this is not the most accurate thing most accurate thing will finally be your simulation but you want to save all that effort how many circuits will i simulate if i can do some back of the calculation and just get a comparison between them that is good enough for me okay then the best case one i will implement that is the intent of this method we'll come to the parasitics in just a moment you will see okay so this is just an estimate yeah this is a logical effort is only about an estimate okay this is not final delay but this is an estimate to compare multiple topologies you can quickly do this and say okay this topology is going to be better you don't need to implement multiple topologies to do that do you know how time consuming implementing a topology epic inverter of an anime you took more than one week is it not yes sir so if you have to make all these inverters how much time will you take and then you are just implementing one eight input and gate so we don't want to do all that effort they simply say can i do a backup another calculation and that is what it is it will give you a fairly good comparative analysis if you want absolute accuracy go simulate so now what would be x and y over here so that i have least delay what do we do where do we start from output huh output okay so what is the logical effort here two input nand gate three input nand gate to input north hello four by three into five by three into five by three 100 by 27 what is the electrical effort quickly pick so 45 by 8 45 by 8 very good what is branching effort 6 3 into 2 6. what is path effort then there are three stages so best stage effort is five we add parasitic delays so two three two seven total delay is three into five i know there are three stages each state has an effort of three three into five and plus seven twenty two hmm and therefore so the fan therefore the the uh what do you say the overall delay that we're talking about is 22 and what is this 4.4 cube root of 22 yeah okay so so what was how do we do that how do we now size y and x how do we now size y and x how do you know find y and x we know that f equal to 5 what is the g for a nor gate uh c out upon s into a course you see yaki so c out is 45 g is 4 by 3 upon 5 answer is 15 so why we know is 15 now so what about x what is the output load of x so we get x equal to 10 and now what we can do quickly is we can check if sax equal to 10 meets the requirement for this also or not i get c n equal to 8 for this or not okay so that we can verify and then we distribute this 15 and 10 and 8 into the pmos and nmos is that okay are you able to see this so here p p four means the width is like it is four times six yes okay yes okay so we've actually got even the gate sizing through this method without a single simulation do you realize this you've got an area estimate without a single simulation yes so now if i have to design let us say a driver to drive a capacitance of 64 i could have multiple number of stairs and if i follow the same topology same methodology you will realize that i could have one inverter like i have my input delay input capacitance fixed as one so i can have multiple ways to size or multiple site i can have multiple stage paths and i can size them according to the method that we just discussed huh and now can we estimate the delays across all of them can we estimate the delays hello so this for this first stage n equal to one one stage only what is f h what is h g is one what is h over here sixty-four c four plus parasitic just one inverter so one so my total delay is 65 okay now i said let's go to two stages so vaishnav would be very happy to say that oh see i was right the delay reduced we go to three stages the nice will be happier oh the debate reduced more let's go to four stages the delay should reduce more but you see it doesn't yes sir i'm sad no sir oh but do you realize that it is important to uh not jump back conclusions just trying to find conclusions just immediately observation evo that is just one observation and also look at it like this see to reduce delay from 65 to 18 what was the area loss one to nine and what is the area over here this is 21 what is the area over here the last driver itself is 23 look at it the last driver is 23 this is approximately 35. so going you you're continuously increasing area you are reducing delays the best less gain is over here then there is still more gain but at an area loss of almost 2.5 times 2.3 times and from here to here similar gain but an area loss of 4 times so you see you're able to estimate both delay and area through this method and then you can choose which could be the best option for your design i know while this is the fastest you may say that oh i am an area sensitive thing so i will keep this do you realize this are you able to see this any questions [Music] sorry so the slide in which 22 is equals to 4.4 was written what was that i was not able to hear that okay we will come to that let me just complete the topic then i will come to that again okay yes sir this part is clear any questions on this that we will be able to so this method immediately gives us a method to this method immediately gives me a comparison of different implementations both in terms of performance and area and i have not done a single simulation are you with me yes sir right,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdk33854gqQ,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdk33854gqQ
Transcript: uh are you a b are you able to see that it is equally easy going backwards because c out we know is fixed so from the last stage we go backward and we do the sizing and then we simply check that is it meeting the input capacitance check or not so let us take the same example that i had shown flashed earlier so what is the effective fanout h for this system five five great sorry uh what is the effective g for this system 5 by 3 whole square 25 by 9 25 by 9. what will be capital f yes so capital f will be 125 by nine i know the number of stages is four so i will do the fourth root of 13.9 i will get f equal to 1.93 and i will essentially get all the sizes abc in my system are you able to see this sir yes sir i have a doubt sir so while we were doing uh previously we were doing f power one by and right sir so that means that uh that's the maximum delay which we can have in a stage but uh you you said that that's the minimum delay which we can have like it's mentioned in the previous slide no so capital f is the total path effort yes i want to design this path to have minimum delay you're getting confused between effort and delay now effort of each stage should be equal to get the minimum delay okay therefore i do fourth root of s there are four stages over here and i get f as one point nine three yes i understood uh yeah understood okay so now based on this because f is 1.93 i will be able to calculate all the delay all the gate delays all the gate sizes okay so we can reduce that we just saw the output cap and then calculated the overall number and then distributed it at every stage and then designed it accordingly yeah we estimated the overall effort yes and said each stage will offer equal effort right okay okay so now based on this can you also estimate which of these eight input and gate configuration will be the best fastest do you think you will be able to do this you can size all of them you can also estimate what the total delay is and

upon capital then i will go okay okay now i need yes you can say capital f plus p you can find the total delay yes you can compare that way also but if you have to size even you can get an estimate of area that is what i am saying the logical effort technique also gives you an estimate of area of the system so what is the trade off area versus speed trade-off you are able to see here are you able to see that yeah yeah if i give more area then i get speed but at what cost of area am i getting that speed is it worth it or not you're able to get that yes yes so edge sir yes can you please move to the previous slide okay yeah the capital s for all of them is 1 by 10 capital f for h capital h would be same capital h would be no it will in fact it may not end up being same because uh uh or you can have a specification of capital h that my input capacitance has to be 1 and has to be 3c and output capacitance has to be something so then the delays would change okay okay and so forth yeah so can i ask right now yeah for the stages the first one has two stage the second has three stages am i right or it will be considered as two stages two sets only and the fourth has four stages yeah okay okay anna yes sir yes as i can calculate that the third option is uh we are getting the low values are in there so uh can we say that if the number of stages are more than our uh this value of delay would be less for something like that can we control something why do you want to jump to such such conclusions when the method to calculate the delay is so simple is the method not simple enough yes sir it's simple but but uh why why unnecessarily complicate your life arrived at this doubt because the uh the values for the first a and b figures for the same size i'm like when i get no right now is going to be a perfect engineer he wants to find shortcuts for everything i'm already giving you a shortcut i'm asking you not to do any simulation and i am able to tell you what the design should be you want a shortcut of that also no nothing yes no no no so let's know uh you know professor respection you must be taking course with them huh yes sir so he very famously says that a good engineer is a lazy person so he looks for shortcuts at all times so i'm not complaining i'm just saying you are going to be a good engineer because you're always continuously looking for shortcuts making life simpler but i would say if you run into deductions into deducing something based on just one example you are putting yourself at risk you should come to such conclusions only after you've seen variety of cases eight example basis but don't arrive at a conclusion yes example you just have one observation not a conclusion yes sir understood okay thank you you will see more examples you will see that what you just said is not valid so this is just one observation consider it as one observation don't jump to a conclusion conclusion you build over time uh sir i have a question sir yes sir in the c case so we have uh four stages suppose in the lower section instead of having a nor gate i have an or gate so at that point of time does it mean that we'll have five stages so how will you make an or gate so nor cascading with inverter so yeah if you if you make an r and then an inverter yes you will have five stairs done but in the uh uh in the above circuit we just have a target which is uh sure that path has just uh of course the technologies this method is agnostic of whatever gate we are talking about is it not yes sir if you have a or gate you will make a nod and then you will make an inverter so you will have those extra status there already so probably what you will end up doing is so if you want to maintain the same logic if you say i will put a or gate here then the next stage instead of being a nand would be a nor gate yes yes and we will not need this inverter so you're putting two inverters here then stages will be four right hanging so again you will have to look at the specific implementation and then do something like don't don't try to conclude yes be with the process if the method is clear then whatever gate i throw at you you should be able to solve it is it not yes seriously i want you to develop that capability yes understood so and why will all this all these things why are we not considering parasitic deals what if sizing some inverter increases by a certain table by too much i'm sorry so um by doing this method if we are not considering parasitic data still we find the optimal sizing so what if the due to optimal sizing my parasitic debris of some stage increases yeah so all those things would happen mother what we are looking at is we want the back of the envelope calculation method this you will finally realize this is not the most accurate thing most accurate thing will finally be your simulation but you want to save all that effort how many circuits will i simulate if i can do some back of the calculation and just get a comparison between them that is good enough for me okay then the best case one i will implement that is the intent of this method we'll come to the parasitics in just a moment you will see okay so this is just an estimate yeah this is a logical effort is only about an estimate okay this is not final delay but this is an estimate to compare multiple topologies you can quickly do this and say okay this topology is going to be better you don't need to implement multiple topologies to do that do you know how time consuming implementing a topology epic inverter of an anime you took more than one week is it not yes sir so if you have to make all these inverters how much time will you take and then you are just implementing one eight input and gate so we don't want to do all that effort they simply say can i do a backup another calculation and that is what it is it will give you a fairly good comparative analysis if you want absolute accuracy go simulate so now what would be x and y over here so that i have least delay what do we do where do we start from output huh output okay so what is the logical effort here two input nand gate three input nand gate to input north hello four by three into five by three into five by three 100 by 27 what is the electrical effort quickly pick so 45 by 8 45 by 8 very good what is branching effort 6 3 into 2 6. what is path effort then there are three stages so best stage effort is five we add parasitic delays so two three two seven total delay is three into five i know there are three stages each state has an effort of three three into five and plus seven twenty two hmm and therefore so the fan therefore the the uh what do you say the overall delay that we're talking about is 22 and what is this 4.4 cube root of 22 yeah okay so so what was how do we do that how do we now size y and x how do we now size y and x how do you know find y and x we know that f equal to 5 what is the g for a nor gate uh c out upon s into a course you see yaki so c out is 45 g is 4 by 3 upon 5 answer is 15 so why we know is 15 now so what about x what is the output load of x so we get x equal to 10 and now what we can do quickly is we can check if sax equal to 10 meets the requirement for this also or not i get c n equal to 8 for this or not okay so that we can verify and then we distribute this 15 and 10 and 8 into the pmos and nmos is that okay are you able to see this so here p p four means the width is like it is four times six yes okay yes okay so we've actually got even the gate sizing through this method without a single simulation do you realize this you've got an area estimate without a single simulation yes so now if i have to design let us say a driver to drive a capacitance of 64 i could have multiple number of stairs and if i follow the same topology same methodology you will realize that i could have one inverter like i have my input delay input capacitance fixed as one so i can have multiple ways to size or multiple site i can have multiple stage paths and i can size them according to the method that we just discussed huh and now can we estimate the delays across all of them can we estimate the delays hello so this for this first stage n equal to one one stage only what is f h what is h g is one what is h over here sixty-four c four plus parasitic just one inverter so one so my total delay is 65 okay now i said let's go to two stages so vaishnav would be very happy to say that oh see i was right the delay reduced we go to three stages the nice will be happier oh the debate reduced more let's go to four stages the delay should reduce more but you see it doesn't yes sir i'm sad no sir oh but do you realize that it is important to uh not jump back conclusions just trying to find conclusions just immediately observation evo that is just one observation and also look at it like this see to reduce delay from 65 to 18 what was the area loss one to nine and what is the area over here this is 21 what is the area over here the last driver itself is 23 look at it the last driver is 23 this is approximately 35. so going you you're continuously increasing area you are reducing delays the best less gain is over here then there is still more gain but at an area loss of almost 2.5 times 2.3 times and from here to here similar gain but an area loss of 4 times so you see you're able to estimate both delay and area through this method and then you can choose which could be the best option for your design i know while this is the fastest you may say that oh i am an area sensitive thing so i will keep this do you realize this are you able to see this any questions [Music] sorry so the slide in which 22 is equals to 4.4 was written what was that i was not able to hear that okay we will come to that let me just complete the topic then i will come to that again okay yes sir this part is clear any questions on this that we will be able to so this method immediately gives us a method to this method immediately gives me a comparison of different implementations both in terms of performance and area and i have not done a single simulation are you with me yes sir right"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,vS6JQgBA_VU,so uh okay many times what would happen is there could be a very big load that could be there on the output but your logic stages the number of logic stages that you have is only say n1 but to get the least delay you would need n stages then what is recommended is that in the first few stages implement your logic and in the final n minus n month stages simply have inverters why do you think this is a recommendation so i mean can you uh just repeat what you're proposing here i mean why need to have end stages so let us say there is the swirling capacitance let us say it is a word line with a capacitance of 500 centifarads and you wanted to make a 8 input and gate to drive this the question is now one eighteen moon and gate cannot simply drive a five hundred twenty five capacitance it's a huge capacitance so you will put some status in between now the question is if i have to put total of n stages where should i put my nand gate in the beginning or in the end closer to the output or earlier early closer to the input okay is the question clear yes is the answer clear it's a logic at the beginning and then inverters yes now why so [Music] would be greater as compared to the inverter so the size is smaller i will make the w smaller okay see consider it like this in the previous example it says you see that the stages closer to the output have larger size so if i have to make a nand of this weight or a nand of this weight what would be the ratio in terms of area if i have to make a nand which has a f of i will need to size it very big is it not yes sir so i don't want to do that to save area all that logic is in the first few stages then you simply add inverters now what does this do this does that your overall delay equation becomes slightly complex and you will have to numerically solve it but you can still do it you can come to a rule of thumb or a you know back of the null of some number even then okay so i mean what kind of calculation are we doing here like after now how many inverters should i come to that is the calculation uh what should be the effort of each stage that is the first that is the first calculation yeah yeah yes i know so that will become slightly complex but that's okay sir yes as i can see the number of inverters should be an even number right sir so so that our output doesn't change uh i could actually have uh inverted output so that is just bubble shifting is it not ah okay okay i could do whatever don't worry about that so uh what we are doing is that we are just i'm not adding the number of stairs as we don't know at which stage we would get the minimum delay uh sorry in stage delay so we are adding those and we are differentiating it uh we are equating it to the first order deflation differential equation to zero so that we can get the uh maximum or minimum water yes yes so because of the presence of parasitics as i said it has no closed form solution if parasitics were zero then i know that rho that is uh stage effort for every state is e but if if i say that p in the parasitic is one unit then you will see that row would come out if each stages stage effort would come out to be around 3.6 okay now in fact what also is done is that just as we saw over here what did we see now the stage the stage effort of each stage over here is much larger than 3.6 is it not the stage effort is 8. over here it is four over here it is two point eight so this as soon as we were close to three point six we had the fastest delay but in a design i missed as i have already mentioned i am still want to go with this implementation because this has much lesser area and the delay is almost similar are you able to see this so while my optimal stage effort i have estimated it to be 3.6 i may want to have much larger stage effort just so that i save area some acknowledgement so this last but i mean stage effort of uh here it was number of area and delay right so what stage are you talking about each stage i'm talking about f the small f yeah is 8 over here yes sir what is the area of this block yeah nine this state effort is four over here which is close to three point six that we just calculated yes sir what is the area over here 25 20 yeah 21 27 yes huh so i increase my area more than double to get enough get a delay improvement of something like uh 15 15 right if i am going for a high density design i may rather say that okay i don't want the best optimal ratio i will go with this yeah yeah huh yes so logical effort over here is telling me what is the optimal thing but my design constraints may anyway push me to a different direction so i may decide differently yes like you said that we need to have in stages kind of thing yes so what we are essentially so and you know uh this that's you if you keep the stage ratio between 2.4 to 6 you will get a delay within a 15 of the optimal optimals optimally fifteen percent sixteen percent you saw that in this example the stage ratio is eight the state effort is eight but even then i'm getting a good result within 20 of that anna so do not get finicky or paranoid about keeping the stage ratio of 3.7 because that is 3.6 because that is what you found is the best in the logical effort analysis you will see depending on your design constraints you could keep a very wide range of stage ratios and you will still be almost optimal so mother you are so worried about kimura parasitic you see we wanted to get a you know a feeling an intuitiveness about all of this and that we are able to get are you able to see this yes sir so and this sensitivity analysis is rho greater than 2.1 distances this is we are talking about the exact simulation thing or we're talking about yeah this is a no this is the numerical analysis thing even now but simulation will give you something similar you will see,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS6JQgBA_VU,"Link:

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,LMeHv7zsxsA,so today we will we are going to in fact start with uh or we will start to look at the process variations we will also talk about projects and if time permits will also probably talk about you know start with power dissipation and power estimation methods so until now what you looked at is delay estimation methods am i right logical effort and all the delay models everything elmo delay everything was delay estimation so we have also looked at stick diagrams but stick diagrams do not give a very clear view of area yet it does give you some sense but not really a very clear view because the concept of width is not there in the stick diagrams so you will get the concept of area when you will work on your projects you already done assignments in which you have drawn in mutual drawn layout so you have some sense of how area is you know impacted when you change the size of devices and power is something that we will start next okay and uh after that we will go into different circuit design styles static cmos pseudo cmos pseudo pseudo nmos dynamic logic and so on so look into various design files for combinational circuit design after that we will look at sequential circuit design and then we will sign off you know this course and like i'm just giving you an overall uh you know a quick overview of what we expect in the second part of this course so later part we will sign off with uh some arithmetic circuits like adders multipliers and uh also memories okay so a quick glimpse of memories also will be there towards the end of this course okay so today we will start to look at uh parametric variations or process variations uh we will have a quick glimpse of why they happen and which we've already discussed so we'll move quickly around that then we will go go to the project part and then we'll start the power dissipation aspect so we designed a inverter such that this black line the black line now which i am overlaying with red now we designed an uh so how do i remove this i can simply remove this so we designed an inverter with this nominal curve of black line but if the pmos's design is faster than what we had anticipated or the n-mass is worse than what we had anticipated then the curve would move to this side on the other hand if the n mass is better than what we had anticipated and pmos is worse than what we had anticipated the curve would move to that side to the left side it is almost like you've changed the beta ratio of your design am i right if you change the beta ratio curve would move don't move on left to right stuff like that you remember yes yeah so if it so happens that pmos is manufactured fast or nmos is manufactured slow then the curve would move to right because it appears to this uh you know in the uh in the kirchhoff's law equation where we or how we determine the transfer characteristics of an inverter we see that pmos will now drive more current and therefore the curve would move to the right the output would stay one for a longer period of time but why is this happening how do we have a good pmos and a bad end moss or a good nmos and a bad female how do we get that and why do we get that it might be due to the manufacturing process yes it is due to manufacturing process runs it so so yes so like you are saying that if the curve is moving to the right or left it means the beta ratio is basically changing sort of so what beta is showing uh is related to the physical property physical characteristics okay so i mean so basically we are saying that whatever it is happening it is due to the physical uh that when the physical device is getting manufactured at that time something is happening which is leading to this kind of yeah you can say electrical beta ratio is changing would that be okay so electrical beta ratio what time what what the term would be yeah electrical beta ratio can be considered as the on current of the n mass upon on current of the p mass okay okay okay because if you have to equate them that is how you will come to the physical w by l beta ratio is it not uh yes sir right now you arrive at any beta ratio so that you get some ratio between the concurrent of the pmos and the nmos is it not yeah yes okay and that is the basis so we're talking about that basis that if the pmos current is more and the nmos current is lesser then it's almost like saying that the beta ratio of this device is such that pmos appears to be larger and nmos appears to be smaller okay it might be like uh the doping of uh pmos is much better than broken or feminist uh i mean so okay they're saying that doping could be one reason why this behavior can happen okay great what else uh so ultimately sir we can say all these factors are leading to change in the resistance of the devices all which factors like factors okay yeah beta resistance is the beta ratio is a consequence of something what can we say it is a mobility change why would mobility change no sudden mobility i i am saying that betas consist of these parameters but mobility will be very great so you are confusing between beta inside the model definition and beta ratio that we talk of as an inverter there are two very different things be careful okay okay so the beta as in model definition is something different from the beta ratio that we were just talking about so can this be due to variation in bt yes we just said no it could be due to vt with doping variations doping variations will lead to vt variations yeah in the chat window someone is saying t ox variations okay yes t ox variations will also lead to something like vp variation yes definitely there are direct impact on beta ratio either so does it have to do something with the temperature temperature means when we save yeah see in this situation when we are plotting them on the same graph we are assuming over here that the voltage of operation and temperature remain same okay but even then something has happened yes okay we are looking at why all those things could happen so yes you know uh for example if there is a variation in t ox that could be because of different duration for which oxide was grown if there was a is there is a variation in doping it could be because of a slightly different duration for which uh phosphine was run over the wafer for example so that phosphorus doping would be different so it could be because of all these little little variations that can happen in the manufacturing process so have we done this exercise in the class already where i asked you to write something 10 times on a piece of paper have it done that exercise yes so you know that they will when in a manufacturing process there can anyways be some variation that can happen however controlled however well controlled the process would be there would still be some variations and they lead to what we call as device variations and these device variations and then modeled into what is called as process slots these variations are due to as we just said vt oxide of an oxide thickness of nmos and p mass effective length effective width and so on so what we say is that we had targeted to make a particular device we call that typical this was the device that we wanted to make okay the center one but then what happened when i was uh let us say doping for the nmos then it happened in such a way that my device for the nmr side would go towards fast so this this dot started to move towards right so nmos doping was such that the device would go too fast then when i was doing doping for the pmos then again it was such that the device would go towards fast let us say so it would go up so i reached this particular place which is called as ff which is fast and mass fast p mass however if while doping for the p mass the doping went towards slow side for the p mass i would go here and i would arrive at a lot which is called as fast and mass slow pmos fs also written as snsp for more clarity okay nmos is fast emotions slow but typically if you say fs then people assume that nmos is being talked about first okay but you can always write it in fnst format so that it is more clear to anyone there okay so now let us say that uh not just so we said that the doping for nmos was towards fast doping for pmos was also towards fast so i reached here now we say that the etching of the poly when we were defining the gate that also happened for a few milliseconds more so what happened both n mass and p mass became a little faster then we say that the oxide thickness was also grown for a slightly lesser time so again both nmos and t mass became faster and we essentially moved from somewhere over here to this point where all the variations are then over overlaid over one over another and we arrived at the fast fast lot so you would add variations come here then add stuff and come somewhere here okay are you getting the sense there are some variations which are correlated and some variations which are independent for example nmos and p must do things happen in different steps so they are independent and most can be doped more and pmos can be doped less but some variations like length and t-oxide thickness they would be similar for both nmos and females are you with me on this any questions so if the body is etched more then it will lead to slower side right of the faster side why is the poly is etched more than the length is shorter if the length is shorter so in the ideas current equation if you just go to that equation for once uh how does the length appear in the equation w by l so but like you said uh that diffusion areas would be fixed for us uh when the mass would be made so if the polish edge move then we will not even get the gate itself not sorry the device itself uh even before we enter into this uh this business of how the drain drain what do you say capacitance etcetera would come into picture we had this lecture on manufacturing process yes what was the sequence of manufacturing steps i mean yes sir so first we destroy deposit the poly then we do a diffusion area so but like even before we are going towards the poly the mass that according to which the diffusion is happening they are they have been already manufactured so if they are polluted so let us review that one how do you make diffusion region in your layout so this man yes sir and then then you make poly yeah so diffusion mask is this is it not yes so now the poly length has reduced what happens the drain will formed it will still form along the gate yeah so this process is called as self-aligned gate and it's a very powerful process because then whatever variations happen to the length the poly may shift this side that side whatever it happens my transistor action will not be impacted my source and drain will be aligned to the gate at all times do you see that hello sir can you please repeat this you do not understand so you tell me what is the process of manufacturing what are the steps how we manufacture a transistor uh so first we'll have the substrate then uh we will introduce the end well after that we will uh deposit the field oxide along with the gate oxide and then we do the etching uh post that we do our implantation and after that after the implantation then yeah we we make the contact windows and then poster we will deposit the method what about the date when will the gate come oh sorry sir after after the uh depositing the gate upside we deposit the policy call okay so when we deposit the polysilicon then we etch the polysilicon after that yes so that is when the gate is formed yes and now after you've etched the polysilicon and you have etched the gate oxide in regions where there was no polysilicon you will now do the implant so that force and drain regions are formed yes so at all times gate will always be in touch with source and drain yes sir now if the sequence of designing source and drain was such that i would make source and drain first and then deposit poly something like this can happen do you see yes sir and this the transistor action will not happen or yes something like this can also happen the poly mass just got shifted by a few nanometers again transistor action would not happen yes sir but in the process that we are using the processes will deposit the poly first yes and when we will deposit the implants for source handling yes so transition action will always happen okay and this is what is called as self-aligned date okay unless that's it thank you okay um you will have to give me a minute my ppt kind of crashed so any other questions around this is this part clear about the self-aligned poly and stuff uh excuse me sir yes so sir the self-aligned gate is a property of the actual process itself it's not of the manufacturing process yes okay so like once we realize that our uh politics has shifted uh here and there we can just realign the entire deposition process it will automatically get realigned okay okay the way you defined the process do you see it will automatically get redefined no yes sir okay are you able to see this so what are we talking about we are saying that i will deposit the gate first now let us say the original position of gate was this but i deposited gate a little to the left after i have deposited the gate i will do the implant for source handling so what happens now the implant for source entering happens like this i still have source and drain there which are connected so the transistor action will still happen in this region even if my poly got misaligned,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMeHv7zsxsA,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMeHv7zsxsA

how do i remove this i can simply remove this so we designed an inverter with this nominal curve of black line but if the pmos's design is faster than what we had anticipated or the n-mass is worse than what we had anticipated then the curve would move to this side on the other hand if the n mass is better than what we had anticipated and pmos is worse than what we had anticipated the curve would move to that side to the left side it is almost like you've changed the beta ratio of your design am i right if you change the beta ratio curve would move don't move on left to right stuff like that you remember yes yeah so if it so happens that pmos is manufactured fast or nmos is manufactured slow then the curve would move to right because it appears to this uh you know in the uh in the kirchhoff's law equation where we or how we determine the transfer characteristics of an inverter we see that pmos will now drive more current and therefore the curve would move to the right the output would stay one for a longer period of time but why is this happening how do we have a good pmos and a bad end moss or a good nmos and a bad female how do we get that and why do we get that it might be due to the manufacturing process yes it is due to manufacturing process runs it so so yes so like you are saying that if the curve is moving to the right or left it means the beta ratio is basically changing sort of so what beta is showing uh is related to the physical property physical characteristics okay so i mean so basically we are saying that whatever it is happening it is due to the physical uh that when the physical device is getting manufactured at that time something is happening which is leading to this kind of yeah you can say electrical beta ratio is changing would that be okay so electrical beta ratio what time what what the term would be yeah electrical beta ratio can be considered as the on current of the n mass upon on current of the p mass okay okay okay because if you have to equate them that is how you will come to the physical w by l beta ratio is it not uh yes sir right now you arrive at any beta ratio so that you get some ratio between the concurrent of the pmos and the nmos is it not yeah yes okay and that is the basis so we're talking about that basis that if the pmos current is more and the nmos current is lesser then it's almost like saying that the beta ratio of this device is such that pmos appears to be larger and nmos appears to be smaller okay it might be like uh the doping of uh pmos is much better than broken or feminist uh i mean so okay they're saying that doping could be one reason why this behavior can happen okay great what else uh so ultimately sir we can say all these factors are leading to change in the resistance of the devices all which factors like factors okay yeah beta resistance is the beta ratio is a consequence of something what can we say it is a mobility change why would mobility change no sudden mobility i i am saying that betas consist of these parameters but mobility will be very great so you are confusing between beta inside the model definition and beta ratio that we talk of as an inverter there are two very different things be careful okay okay so the beta as in model definition is something different from the beta ratio that we were just talking about so can this be due to variation in bt yes we just said no it could be due to vt with doping variations doping variations will lead to vt variations yeah in the chat window someone is saying t ox variations okay yes t ox variations will also lead to something like vp variation yes definitely there are direct impact on beta ratio either so does it have to do something with the temperature temperature means when we save yeah see in this situation when we are plotting them on the same graph we are assuming over here that the voltage of operation and temperature remain same okay but even then something has happened yes okay we are looking at why all those things could happen so yes you know uh for example if there is a variation in t ox that could be because of different duration for which oxide was grown if there was a is there is a variation in doping it could be because of a slightly different duration for which uh phosphine was run over the wafer for example so that phosphorus doping would be different so it could be because of all these little little variations that can happen in the manufacturing process so have we done this exercise in the class already where i asked you to write something 10 times on a piece of paper have it done that exercise yes so you know that they will when in a manufacturing process there can anyways be some variation that can happen however controlled however well controlled the process would be there would still be some variations and they lead to what we call as device variations and these device variations and then modeled into what is called as process slots these variations are due to as we just said vt oxide of an oxide thickness of nmos and p mass effective length effective width and so on so what we say is that we had targeted to make a particular device we call that typical this was the device that we wanted to make okay the center one but then what happened when i was uh let us say doping for the nmos then it happened in such a way that my device for the nmr side would go towards fast so this this dot started to move towards right so nmos doping was such that the device would go too fast then when i was doing doping for the pmos then again it was such that the device would go towards fast let us say so it would go up so i reached this particular place which is called as ff which is fast and mass fast p mass however if while doping for the p mass the doping went towards slow side for the p mass i would go here and i would arrive at a lot which is called as fast and mass slow pmos fs also written as snsp for more clarity okay nmos is fast emotions slow but typically if you say fs then people assume that nmos is being talked about first okay but you can always write it in fnst format so that it is more clear to anyone there okay so now let us say that uh not just so we said that the doping for nmos was towards fast doping for pmos was also towards fast so i reached here now we say that the etching of the poly when we were defining the gate that also happened for a few milliseconds more so what happened both n mass and p mass became a little faster then we say that the oxide thickness was also grown for a slightly lesser time so again both nmos and t mass became faster and we essentially moved from somewhere over here to this point where all the variations are then over overlaid over one over another and we arrived at the fast fast lot so you would add variations come here then add stuff and come somewhere here okay are you getting the sense there are some variations which are correlated and some variations which are independent for example nmos and p must do things happen in different steps so they are independent and most can be doped more and pmos can be doped less but some variations like length and t-oxide thickness they would be similar for both nmos and females are you with me on this any questions so if the body is etched more then it will lead to slower side right of the faster side why is the poly is etched more than the length is shorter if the length is shorter so in the ideas current equation if you just go to that equation for once uh how does the length appear in the equation w by l so but like you said uh that diffusion areas would be fixed for us uh when the mass would be made so if the polish edge move then we will not even get the gate itself not sorry the device itself uh even before we enter into this uh this business of how the drain drain what do you say capacitance etcetera would come into picture we had this lecture on manufacturing process yes what was the sequence of manufacturing steps i mean yes sir so first we destroy deposit the poly then we do a diffusion area so but like even before we are going towards the poly the mass that according to which the diffusion is happening they are they have been already manufactured so if they are polluted so let us review that one how do you make diffusion region in your layout so this man yes sir and then then you make poly yeah so diffusion mask is this is it not yes so now the poly length has reduced what happens the drain will formed it will still form along the gate yeah so this process is called as self-aligned gate and it's a very powerful process because then whatever variations happen to the length the poly may shift this side that side whatever it happens my transistor action will not be impacted my source and drain will be aligned to the gate at all times do you see that hello sir can you please repeat this you do not understand so you tell me what is the process of manufacturing what are the steps how we manufacture a transistor uh so first we'll have the substrate then uh we will introduce the end well after that we will uh deposit the field oxide along with the gate oxide and then we do the etching uh post that we do our implantation and after that after the implantation then yeah we we make the contact windows and then poster we will deposit the method what about the date when will the gate come oh sorry sir after after the uh depositing the gate upside we deposit the policy call okay so when we deposit the polysilicon then we etch the polysilicon after that yes so that is when the gate is formed yes and now after you've etched the polysilicon and you have etched the gate oxide in regions where there was no polysilicon you will now do the implant so that force and drain regions are formed yes so at all times gate will always be in touch with source and drain yes sir now if the sequence of designing source and drain was such that i would make source and drain first and then deposit poly something like this can happen do you see yes sir and this the transistor action will not happen or yes something like this can also happen the poly mass just got shifted by a few nanometers again transistor action would not happen yes sir but in the process that we are using the processes will deposit the poly first yes and when we will deposit the implants for source handling yes so transition action will always happen okay and this is what is called as self-aligned date okay unless that's it thank you okay um you will have to give me a minute my ppt kind of crashed so any other questions around this is this part clear about the self-aligned poly and stuff uh excuse me sir yes so sir the self-aligned gate is a property of the actual process itself it's not of the manufacturing process yes okay so like once we realize that our uh politics has shifted uh here and there we can just realign the entire deposition process it will automatically get realigned okay okay the way you defined the process do you see it will automatically get redefined no yes sir okay are you able to see this so what are we talking about we are saying that i will deposit the gate first now let us say the original position of gate was this but i deposited gate a little to the left after i have deposited the gate i will do the implant for source handling so what happens now the implant for source entering happens like this i still have source and drain there which are connected so the transistor action will still happen in this region even if my poly got misaligned"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,TZ3aN2GsTdo,okay i got it okay thank you okay so now tell me one thing if lf if l effective is reduced that is police etched a little more what happens will i get a fast device or a slow device huh it will be fast it will be fast why because we know that the model is okay w by l into v g s minus v t the whole square stuff like that so l comes in the denominator if the length is lesser etching has happened a little more then the current will be more so i get a fast device so how should my vt change how should my vt change to get a fast device should vt reduce or should be increase it should reduce it should reduce why because of the vgs minus vt is down yes yes if vt reduces vgs minus vt term increases and therefore current increases great what about t ox uh t-offs also should reduce nominally uh uh also it should uh yeah because you need to increase the uh c off yes as the t-ox reduces it increases the c-ox which leads to more current uh but sir all of these like yeah that is happening but my device is on current is more yeah i know so that is what you're trying to find out how will the device become fast so all these things will lead to a fast device on the other side larger lengths high vt thicker gate oxide would meet to a slow device huh and while stuff like l effective and t ox is correlated for both nmos and p mass dopant implant is independent for example so it can happen that you will get fast fast lot also where just by chance both nmos and pmos move towards fast direction but you can also come to ss and fs slots where nmos move to one side and pmos move to the other is that part clear uh sir can you revisit the uh concept where the vt is dependent upon the doping i mean uh like how was bt changing i mean okay so svt if the doping is more let us say what happens so so we are talking of the diffusion doping right um no not just that we're talking of doping even under the gate the substrate doping also yeah okay so what happens if the doping in the under the gate changes because that is where the transistor action happens diffusion are just sources of current yes sir i know so it's under the date that the way you dope that will change the transistor behavior so if you increase the doping a bit what happens the depletion width reduces yeah under the diffusion the diffusion and the substrate is the gate the depletion width would reduce yes sir huh if the depletion which reduces then what happens so but when i am taking the transistor action i should not be talking about the depletion bit right because that is not that because then i'm not considering that what is vt after the inversion after depletion inversion player forms that is yes after the after the after the depletion maximum depletion width has happened then the inversion layer sets in so if i am saying that the maximum depletion layer will now happen faster so what will be t has come to vc will have come with vt will happen faster vt will be low okay yes pattern so i have doubt in the sweaty part if the doping is more so suppose we have a n well and the p plus doping on the source entry so if the if the doping is more in the substrate then the electrons in that the the region below the gate is gone now we need more vgs to remove those electron and get the uh get the holes from the p plus so i think vt will be more in that case so uh essentially what we are saying is that uh when we change the doping when we change the doping vt will get impacted yes there could be multiple directions in which my my system will move due to variations in doping in fact you will realize that in advance technologies there are retrograde implants there are super halo implants there are halo implants and so such complex doping that whatever picture we are talking about faizal is is largely hypothetical and just for ease of understanding okay the actual process is fairly complex with multiple multiple features figuring in yes yes so what is most important to arrive at so you can study all that in detail when we do ssd what is most important to arrive at is that doping for nmos and p mass is going to be different it will be independent steps yes yes so vt shift of nmos and pmos will happen in different directions what can happen in different directions that's the point we need to take back home okay okay okay because i agree you know we will uh i i i would have encouraged much more digressions but earlier in the course now we are you know we have to move fast towards our target of uh coming to circuits so yes you can study more reference material even in west a and harris you will have more material about how vt shift happens with doping and all that you will if you take ssd course you will read much more about how easy shifts happen and how it is impacted by doping yes so actually it was discussed in the ssd course uh that's why i'm asking yeah so uh there are so ssc must have also discussed halo and superhero implants uh no not yet not yet so you will see that in all the advanced technologies where these implants are in picture it is not so obvious to say doping it is also about the depth at which doping has happened the size of the hello so many things yes okay i understood your concept okay so what is important to understand is some some variation sources of variation are correlated others are independent and therefore you have et lot that is the target and ss slow and mass low pmos fs fast and most fast p mass and also sf and fast and more slow pmos kind of plots yes ma'am i didn't understand why would increasing the dopamine you know um you know decrease the maximum indication but that will take us completely off the phone so i'll just ask an officer yeah we can study that later or we can discuss this in the office is that okay so now if we know that my circuit can happen or can be or my wafer can be manufactured in any of these lots then it isn't it evident that i should verify all these lots when i do my design by lots of meaning the die complete die lot means a set of for 25 wafers okay all the 25 wafers that are in the lot for example would have one kind of doping because the doping happens uh the uh the doping happens in one go for for a set of 25 wafers substrate doping at least now when we talk about when we talk about halo and super hello then so this was how the lot the word lot had arrived at okay but in advanced technologies when you talk about complex uh substrate uh doping engineering then you would do that doping on a wafer wi-fi services so that would then appear as a lot then the lot variations are now limited to one wafer only okay but in older technologies the lot very the lot meant a set of 25 wafers that would go into the doping machine simultaneously so just the trivia uh if this lot you can see over 25 wafers so then this 25 all the wafers and all the dives will be corresponding to one process corner right yes okay now it is not so simple it can happen that so let us look at it like this when you doped them they all went towards let us say fs all of them but then what happened the substrate doping you had done and then what happened you started to deposit the gate and the gate deposition was towards the fast you know the etching of the gate happens a little more so you moved a little here then something has happened you could have moved a little here for example so there will be so many routes through which the lots could be manufactured anywhere in between these so this whole area this region is where your dyes will be manufactured these are just model representations you will get only these models so that you verify only these corner points so these are called pvt con vt corners or process corners that doesn't mean a lot will be manufactured only in these five points lot should be manufactured everywhere these are the corners of that distribution okay any questions okay so now coming to the next part which is that are these the only reasons why why delays or something would change or could delay change because of something else also temperature temperature temperature okay vdd used the voltage of operation yes let me show you have a question uh sir uh it was related to something earlier sir you said that a lot is a set of papers so sir um so uh i understood that there will be variations in the uh slots so uh if in multiple way person so there will be variations within the wafer also yes we'll come to that we'll come to that not just within a wafer you will see that there are variations within a diode there are die two diversions also very okay so okay i know yes so all that will happen don't worry we will we will discuss all that if you just give me a minute my ppt seems to be playing cranky today so we are also talking about the next thing that we need to look at is vp variations so what happens to the uh the variations and delays due to vdd and temperature uh mother you had a question uh yes sir in in virtuoso when we try to run simulation we either do it for so he said that our final device would be anywhere between in this region only so it doesn't necessarily have to be that any of the corners right so how do you decide corner is a corner corner is just one point in reality the device can be manufactured anywhere now so how do we simulate such that the origins that we simulate the behavior of the manufacture device and not just the converse do you really want to simulate intermediate points mother what would you achieve by that doesn't this mean that our transistor wouldn't work so this would mean that our transistor is not working uh exactly as we intended it to be it's not as the simulation so it is not as bad as slow as you had possibly designed it for it could be faster yes or it is not as fast as you had qualified the whole time or it could be slower than that yes okay but do you really want to check for those intermediate transistors also if it matters then we should check if it doesn't you tell me you tell me you tell me would it matter maybe something no it may it may matter no no maybe let us logically arrive at a solution because if i say that i have to test every point that could exist on that space you see there could be infinite points henna yes so that would mean that my verification effort would go like anything it would expand like anything so my design time my time to market will go for a toss as a designer we cannot simply say maybe not work okay so so we know beforehand that if we are using this manufacturing process that it will lie near fast near some of those corners and we say it will be within this rhombus okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ3aN2GsTdo,"Link:

anything it would expand like anything so my design time my time to market will go for a toss as a designer we cannot simply say maybe not work okay so so we know beforehand that if we are using this manufacturing process that it will lie near fast near some of those corners and we say it will be within this rhombus okay"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,EH8zEetiYco,in this so do you know the concept of temperature inversion do you know the dependence of mobility on temperature yes sir so what happens to mobility as temperature increases be proportional to the power minus three by two is it nice yeah yeah okay is there anything else in terms of temperature that mobility is dependent on i mean there are two kinds of scattering we consider and it creates increases both plus and minus yes so as temperature increases the scattering also increases mobility actually overall current actually degrades okay this is at high voltages however when you are operating at low voltages the total number of carriers that you have in the in the conduction band they are not much so when you increase the temperature that carrier boost is much more than the scattering that would have happened because of uh lattice vibration and anything like that okay and therefore at lower voltages uh higher temperatures lead to a better current yes so can we your mobility is decreasing higher voltage is always better current is it not a higher voltage is better current but higher temperature was like reduced so what happens at low voltages the voltage is or the voltage is so low that the gate overdrive let us say is not sufficient even if the gate overdrive is sufficient we say that the number of carriers that you have in the conduction band to be able to conduct the current that is not much there are carriers inversion is already set and we know that but even then there is something missing as you increase the temperature more carriers come into picture carriers have more energy now so they move they move faster also sir i mean uh temperatures or also actually decreases the threshold voltage yeah so see threshold voltage reduction is also a consequence of this affects that number of carriers and all that yes looking at the different definitions of threshold you see all these are different ways of pointing at the same phenomena current increase on a vt reduce on all their they are you you one could say that because current has increased therefore vp has reduced because vt definition is one micron pair of current for a one micron with device anna so ah yeah is this part clear hello temperature and impact of temperature and voltage on circuit performance is that part clear does need to have a question say slide is not visible sir when this industry you have written that dvd is higher and the temperature is low so though our device is becoming faster sir but the that the sub threshold leakage will increase yeah on fast devices is known to be higher yes sir yes sir we have to compromise it yeah yeah that is known to be higher okay so now tell me uh if you have to verify then what will be the pvts at which you will design and verify your you know pvt means process temperature and voltage for which you will design and verify your circuits hello slow slow sir slow slow what about voltage uh slow slow with low voltage temperature high high high temperature so apne have you checked your assignment three i've asked you to characterize at multiple pvps yes yes so now can you identify and relate why so many pvts are being asked for yes sir they're all about these various corners and also what you will see is that for some parameters like for for timings delays slow everything putting everything to slow leads to worst case result but for some other parameters putting everything too fast would lead to worst case results and in terms of leakage it's a mix of slow and fast because you want high temperature to see worst case leakage are you able to see this like the worst case in case of so the worst case in k uh in case of fast pass will be for whole time likewise yes contamination delays will be worst in the fast fast low temperature and everything propagation delays will be worse than slow slow high low voltage and high temperature sub threshold leakage as as we rightly pointed out is is higher when you have fast and mass fast p mass when vdd is also high but for high leakage we need to have the higher temperature so the temperature is related to the slow temperature 125 degree celsius that is where you need mix of different pvts to overall characterize your designs that is why this long list of pvp is there so is that all is that all that we need to worry about or is there something else which line so just like important this one uh no sir i mean like the one you were currently on like last time after that so when i asked the doubt we were on important quarters like for [Music] okay so we just saw on our delay our first when n masses flow pmos is slow vdd is low and temperature is high it's just tabulating it in one pump that's it yeah power would also be higher also because of leakage being higher when uh your uh you know voltage of operation is higher it is cv square f so the capacitance is higher when the devices are fast v is higher vdd means we want to increase cv square f so we really have to be higher and we know frequency is highest when the temperature is low so cv square f is highest when uh or power is highest when everything is towards the fast side okay yes yeah so some of you already pointed out okay okay we can have all these lots so in reality what you get is not a rhombus what you get is actually an ellipse and on that ellipse you define what is called as uh you know one sigma ellipse two sigma ellipse and three sigma ellipse you say everything within this is considered as typical and this part is slow let us say okay so all models ssf all that rhombus that we looked at it is a fitting exercise you have to arrive at a rhombus over here which would be safe for designing purposes there may still be some lots which will be out of the humbles and you agree that on those lots you accept some extra heal loss okay in addition to that see whichever lot i have designed at suppose a lot is placed here you will see that there will be uh variations on that particular wafer itself these are called device variations so until now you are looking at lot variations now these are called device variations and to validate a design with device variations you go to the ss corner or ff corner or whatever corner you're talking about and you run monte carlo there what is monte carlo so if there are more number of inputs i will be using monte carlo analysis is an analysis in which you will vary different parameters which are known to exhibit variations so what are the parameters over here that we know will exhibit variations intrinsic parameter over here that will in the exhibit variation doping l effective w effective stuff like that so you vary all those parameters for different devices and randomly place those variations on different devices then when you simulate what you will get is a this red shaded circles around that lot point it is a sample of transistors that could be manufactured on that particular lot oh so can you explain this again actually i wasn't even getting this wow for a particular lot what we are doing exactly here so we were just talking that if there is a wafer even on that wafer there could be variations that could happen in a device which is manufactured towards the top of the wafer and then a device which is manufactured towards the right side of the wafer yes sir so it means that for even a lot there will be other device variations which will come into picture yes yes so how do you validate those so one part of validation we said okay we will we will uh test or characterize and design our stuff at circuits at ss 1.125 well ss low voltage high temperature and all that we just agreed that we will do that but for final circuit verification you also need to take into account device variations and that is what you will do by the means of running monte carlo simulations this is called as monte carlo analysis also in which different variations are applied to different transistors so that the example that we just saw that one pmos is fast and the nmos is flow those those situations can appear even in a fast pass lot or even in a slow slow lot where they were expected to both move in the same direction like when when the when it was starting i was taking the pbt variations in the law for the for a lot basically i said that okay my nmos will be slow slow slow and this vdd and temperature kind of way so by that i had considered the lot variations of the lord thing and now even i'm going uh once i pick up a certain corner rhombus then i'm going into that particular corner yeah and doing the same exercise of pain more slow pmos and more than vdd yes again again injecting variations in there okay and seeing how the devices in this particular lot can lead to the change in my circuit functionality okay so sir like when we have been for example in the virtuous itself when we are doing the simulation with the adel window so when we are selecting the sources that at that time we were selecting the slow slow and the temperature that are basically the uh not basically lot variations yes there are lot variations okay sir so in conclusion we can see that within this slot there are this this is the uh wafer and this wafer has this four corner devices that fast fast low slow and this four and there so this graph here is the lot variations so here basically there is four possibility of uh no there are infinite possibilities of devices that is why we have made this ellipse there so in this there is no fast fast low slow error the corner points we call them fast fast and slow slow okay some corner points of the cells we call them as fast fast and slow slow but there will only probably be a few lots in those exact those corners majority of lots will be enclosed in the in the in the rhombus there so okay okay okay excuse me sir yes so for this left graph so that was that is the lot variation yeah left and right both are lot variations only but then on the right one i've just made this red circle which is device variation so what is the y-axis in both of them for the for the left graph the y-axis are threshold voltages and for the right graph the x and y-axis are currents id okay so but we could run this monte carlo simulation on the left graph as well yeah yeah you just choose a lot and you run monte carlo variations and you will get a distribution of all these points okay sir okay okay yes sir uh we how my question is for tt uh so do we uh do the does the foundry provide us a real uh because uh we cannot be very sure that which is the most uh middle point always so every time you manufacture the middle point also might vary so um according to me that tt should be calculated theoretically and with reference to that we should uh decide ff and ss or or the foundry only provides every time the tt lord tt parameters the foundry will give you the lots always even the ss and the ff plots the foundry will give you you don't decide as a as a designer listen my question was like tt should be an averaged out value of all the corners right because every foundry may have a different uh way to arrive at ttd park some foundry may say that okay this pt will be my target okay okay i am i suppose today you want to design in three nanometers the technology is not even there or even if it is there it is in a prototype stage you do not even know what kind of variations will finally happen not happen so where you will finally place your tt you know you still not figured out the final devices or the final materials that you will use in your gate dielectric and stuff like that you have a prototype technology running so in such cases the models will be called paper model largely paper models where we're talking about specifications but as the technology matures for example if today you would want to talk about 18 nanometer or a 22 nanometer or 28 nanometer technology is very mature so now et is actually given by the lot by the by the process that okay there are majority of wafers which have been manufactured in this place so this is my teacher all right so my question is that yeah we like we were doing the simulations in eldor so we had the files with us but and they were tt also in that so but in the real life that ttu might change over the time yeah so in real life gap in the evolution of a technology it will definitely change okay sure that okay okay but uh once the technology is frozen once the process is well in control and the foundry has defined that this is my tt then that tt then remains constant then if you take a lot and it is towards fast you say it is it is not tt that's it sure you know but as the technology evolves tt would change yes sure thank you so much yeah so is the question clear to others also is the answer clear to others also so so like uh into both the graphs after we have uh the foundry has provided us with basically the lord corners then this red basically carves that we are doing by ourselves for the monte carlo for the device kind of analysis on that particular right yeah okay and what he was also asking was will tt always be constantly a hypothetical value or from driven from the process so what i responded was that when the technology is not very mature tt would be paper models in fact all the corners will also be paired by models but as the technology matures tt and all the other corners will be silicon divine models and the positions would change over time yes they breathe so just to confirm one thing in in both the graphs uh set the ff and ss would be reverse right uh yes on the left graph ff would be towards the bottom corner towards the origin side yes and on the right graph it will be the ss will be towards origin side okay yeah yeah thank you sir good observation so because saturation current is more on the right side exactly so i can confuse you in the in the mid sems and tell you you have to carefully look at the access and then decide okay okay so uh in addition to these tt ssf things we also have what is called as ffs and ssf lots or points they are essentially the result of when i run monte carlo on ff and ss i see that the worst case nmos and pmos combo can happen over here so when you are you know verifying small circuits you may want to verify them over these points also you do not characterize them because in characterization part usually a small circuit is not an end in itself you would have many circuits uh cascaded one after another and the overall delays would never be at fff or ssf but when you are just verifying your circuits you may want to verify them at these functional points also not all boundaries provided but quite a few foundries do provide these functional models okay so they may call this as ffg ssg sfg and fsg also but yeah they may also provide these functional models in addition to that okay so now yes sir how are we supposed to unlike uh uh do this montage on the simulation in in the simulator and like in in cadence yeah so you can look into the user manual you just have a command called dot mc okay okay you just use the command command dot mc you tell which parameters you want to vary and you tell how many number of simulations you want to do so it will run the monte carlo simulations for you it is available in the user manual okay so now see we know that the a device may be manufactured let us say fast but on fast we also know the leakage is very high and the delays are much lesser so you signed off you designed something for to operate at 2 gigahertz now a die is manufactured or a lot is manufactured which is operating at 3 gigahertz now overall ecosystem you cannot really operate the system at three gigahertz because there could be uh resonance issues there could be inductive effects which would come into picture and so on so you anyway want to operate the particular diet two gigahertz but uh the devices are fast so you say and my leakage is very high you say can i do something to arrive at two gigahertz instead of three gigahertz but i reduce the leakage so what would you do you can do multiple things you can for example apply body bias what happens when you apply reverse body bias devices start to move towards slow then vt starts to increase basically another thing that you can do is you can reduce the voltage of operation you can say see i wanted to operate at 2 gigahertz at 1.2 volts now at 1.2 volts i am already getting 3 gigahertz why not operate at 1.15 or 1.1 2 volts and i will come to 2 i will come to 2 gigahertz and now because i am operating at a lower voltage i will also consume lesser power so these two techniques so this is where you are changing the body bias is what called adaptive body wires and the other one which where i said that you could lower the vdd or if you are on the slow lot you want to improve the performance you could increase the vdd a bit because you know that at higher vdd performances are higher so that is called adaptive voltage scaling ok so these again are areas of active research there is lots of work happening uh in their even production these these technologies are even production where uh dyes are trimmed to operate at lower voltage or higher voltage depending on where they were manufactured at so at the time of test you see what is the operational frequency and you trim them what is the leakage and you trim them appropriately okay so so the body bias was applied for the fast pass and the voltage for this torso so i could apply voltage for fast fast also i could lower the voltage and reduce the overall power consumption okay right both these techniques are available for the corners [Music] yes i'm trying to bring the device back into my specification for say let us say leakage or power consumption or timing or whatever okay i process compensation you will see is used in a large number of products today already it's not a new concept that we're talking about any longer okay something is also raghav yeah i mean so this body bias thing was considering this body bias can basically further create more complications like i mean like i'm not able to exactly pinpoint but i think that like something things like you can glitch like further like uh because early when we are considering like when we're doing the substrate taping and tapping and we're connecting the source with the body we are sort of uh those latch up effects and many other things can pop up yes so very very good raga i'm so happy that you're able to anticipate the problems that can come with body bias so uh in terms of forward body bias you have to realize that you cannot really power body bias your pn junctions beyond anything beyond 0.2 or 0.3 volts because otherwise the leakage currents would kind of run off similarly on the side of reverse body bias there would be constraints on how much reverse body bias you can put again because otherwise a band-to-man tunneling will kind of enough there will be lots of current that will flow from the source to the substrate or drain to the substrate so you cannot really do a lot of body bias so very good and very interesting observation however in advanced technologies like fds soi fully depleted soi so there is no junction in the source and drain region there is simply a buried oxide so since there is no junction so there is no concept of junction leakage per se or and junction leakage cannot increase so you can apply whatever amount of powered body buyers or reverse body buyers that you want to you are talking about here the soi technology yes okay the fully depleted soi not even partially if you were on partially depleted soi then again you will face trouble because junction would be there only in fully depleted soi you can actually go to very large range of uh body bias voltages okay yes okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH8zEetiYco,"Link:

Transcript: in this so do you know the concept of temperature inversion do you know the dependence of mobility on temperature yes sir so what happens to mobility as temperature increases be proportional to the power minus three by two is it nice yeah yeah okay is there anything else in terms of temperature that mobility is dependent on i mean there are two kinds of scattering we consider and it creates increases both plus and minus yes so as temperature increases the scattering also increases mobility actually overall current actually degrades okay this is at high voltages however when you are operating at low voltages the total number of carriers that you have in the in the conduction band they are not much so when you increase the temperature that carrier boost is much more than the scattering that would have happened because of uh lattice vibration and anything like that okay and therefore at lower voltages uh higher temperatures lead to a better current yes so can we your mobility is decreasing higher voltage is always better current is it not a higher voltage is better current but higher temperature was like reduced so what happens at low voltages the voltage is or the voltage is so low that the gate overdrive let us say is not sufficient even if the gate overdrive is sufficient we say that the number of carriers that you have in the conduction band to be able to conduct the current that is not much there are carriers inversion is already set and we know that but even then there is something missing as you increase the temperature more carriers come into picture carriers have more energy now so they move they move faster also sir i mean uh temperatures or also actually decreases the threshold voltage yeah so see threshold voltage reduction is also a consequence of this affects that number of carriers and all that yes looking at the different definitions of threshold you see all these are different ways of pointing at the same phenomena current increase on a vt reduce on all their they are you you one could say that because current has increased therefore vp has reduced because vt definition is one micron pair of current for a one micron with device anna so ah yeah is this part clear hello temperature and impact of temperature and voltage on circuit performance is that part clear does need to have a question say slide is not visible sir when this industry you have written that dvd is higher and the temperature is low so though our device is becoming faster sir but the that the sub threshold leakage will increase yeah on fast devices is known to be higher yes sir yes sir we have to compromise it yeah yeah that is known to be higher okay so now tell me uh if you have to verify then what will be the pvts at which you will design and verify your you know pvt means process temperature and voltage for which you will design and verify your circuits hello slow slow sir slow slow what about voltage uh slow slow with low voltage temperature high high high temperature so apne have you checked your assignment three i've asked you to characterize at multiple pvps yes yes so now can you identify and relate why so many pvts are being asked for yes sir they're all about these various corners and also what you will see is that for some parameters like for for timings delays slow everything putting everything to slow leads to worst case result but for some other parameters putting everything too fast would lead to worst case results and in terms of leakage it's a mix of slow and fast because you want high temperature to see worst case leakage are you able to see this like the worst case in case of so the worst case in k uh in case of fast pass will be for whole time likewise yes contamination delays will be worst in the fast fast low temperature and everything propagation delays will be worse than slow slow high low voltage and high temperature sub threshold leakage as as we rightly pointed out is is higher when you have fast and mass fast p mass when vdd is also high but for high leakage we need to have the higher temperature so the temperature is related to the slow temperature 125 degree celsius that is where you need mix of different pvts to overall characterize your designs that is why this long list of pvp is there so is that all is that all that we need to worry about or is there something else which line so just like important this one uh no sir i mean like the one you were currently on like last time after that so when i asked the doubt we were on important quarters like for [Music] okay so we just saw on our delay our first when n masses flow pmos is slow vdd is low and temperature is high it's just tabulating it in one pump that's it yeah power would also be higher also

increase cv square f so we really have to be higher and we know frequency is highest when the temperature is low so cv square f is highest when uh or power is highest when everything is towards the fast side okay yes yeah so some of you already pointed out okay okay we can have all these lots so in reality what you get is not a rhombus what you get is actually an ellipse and on that ellipse you define what is called as uh you know one sigma ellipse two sigma ellipse and three sigma ellipse you say everything within this is considered as typical and this part is slow let us say okay so all

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,b2wwYMU-emI,okay okay so now we come to the uh today's session so so to say which is power distribution so what do you understand by the term power dissipation cv square cv square that is all about power dissipation but the first thing that comes into mind is that the first thing that comes to your mind is cv square okay so you say that there is some power that is consumed uh when the operation is happening so that essentially is dynamic power where you say okay this is something linked to cv square let us say hello okay and then what about uh short circuit currents what the short circuit current so is that we observed like with that observed during the in the uh static analysis analysis that there is a point when both are on both are in the saturation and there is a direction so it is this when the short circuit path exists between vdd and ground between the supply rails during the switching operation that is what is called as short circuit current and the third component of power is leakage the one that we were just happening about so dynamic power consumption if i said it is cv square huh so actually it's proportional to cv square it's not cv square but it's proportional to cv square so the power so but before we go into what it is let us just also have a look at power as it is drawn from the voltage source so power when you talk of it in terms of instantaneous power would be characterized as i t into vt that is current at any given point of time into the voltage at that point of time energy is integration of that power over time over the entire cycle and average power is then normalized energy over time what are you interested in as a designer what do you think is quoted on the data sheet so there are two questions after considering the complete so we should be more concerned about the dynamic power so this is all about dynamic so dynamic power is one component of it from it ibm those components that we are not even at those components yet we are saying amongst these three things instantaneous power energy and average power what are you most interested in sir uh i think it should be instantaneous power sir uh because we we must be much precise about the current which we are flowing at a particular instant in our transfer or something why because uh however in the average power we somehow get to reduce the whole value to a particular point but in instantaneous power uh it might happen like sometimes the voltage is low and the current is high so that this high current might not i mean like they uh totally collapse our circuit okay so what vaishnav is saying is that i'm also interested in instantaneous power in fact he's saying i'm only interested in instantaneous power because that gives me an estimate of what kind of current is flowing and with that i can design my power grid the current should not be so high that my power grid collapses so somewhere i am interested in instantaneous power because it will give me an estimate of what kind of ir drop can happen so i am interested in instantaneous power but when i am making a product i am also interested in energy that is what is the total energy consumed for example in one calculation so that i can then prolong the life of a calculator to run you know one million calculations before the battery dies off because i have a very small battery pencil battery there and filling button battery there and average power why do you think average power is important why is it even there on this screen there sir to calculate our consumptions at last i'm like at the end of the day i'm like okay for a laptop or something the consumption might be low but for uh high appliances then we are much like looking into the power so that yeah we don't depend up uh we don't end up consuming high amount of power on a device so when you turn a system on a circuit on let us say you just even turn your tube light on or you you know a light bulb on do you think it consumes the same power throughout closer what happens at the time when you're just turning it on there could be extra sparks extra power consumed because if it's a tungsten bulb the initial heating needs to happen something needs to do to be done some extra power may go initially but then you still quote one number that okay it will consume one watt this is a one watt bulb or six watt bulb or something like that is it not yes so that is average power i think yes that is average power for a user to make a decision on which component to use that user needs a value of average power a typical user a typical consumer is not interested in instantaneous power now since the specification is given in terms of average power a designer should also be concerned about average power also but a designer also needs to look at instantaneous power so that there are no serious eye drop issues in any part of your design sir yes sir but i'm not able to get the instantaneous power because when you're designing the power range then we basically give the voltages across we fix the voltages vdd and ground and the i drop is whatever is happening it is happening because of the interconnects because of the wires and the interconnects through which we are basically transferring that but so ultimately what exactly the power would be instantaneous part would be at a particular time would be basically defined by this speed level now because ultimately because of the transfer what all things is i dependent on let us look at that okay what are things is i dependent on sir i think if there's a capacitor then uh there might be a spike of icer i'm like it's possible right here at any point of time we might have a capacitor in between and it might have a spike might have a capacitor do you think there might there is a possibility of a capacitor do you know there are capacitors yeah there are capacitors but there are some places that are i'm not even we find some places where there are no capacitors so uh i mean the the variation of it which we have isn't i'm like isn't that linear which we think of and like so you tell me you've done simulations already done yes sir yes sir that's that's the reason why i'm like for suppose that miller capacitance effect in which we uh see pick up your simulations and you will have answers to all these questions right now yes so i am asking you a different question what does i depend on the resistance of wire the the current depends on okay these resistances and supply supply level okay and we're talking about the inverter cmos circuit the resistance of the channel the resistance of the channel okay and so the region of operation so width and the length yeah that would define the resistance of the channel so the region of operation the region of operation would move from all saturation to linear to everything no yes okay one very important thing slew okay that will say for how long the short circuit current will flow yes okay good what else very important thing include is we have included in the channel resistance because we talked about current already now you're talking about current in the channel resistance we have included vt and mobility both you see very important thing load yes something equally important charge so current means charge so tell me there what does what do you mean by charge integration of current over time leads to charge so charge is dependent on the kind of current flowing or what what do you mean to say with charge there your operating voltage yeah we already talked about operating voltage the number of times this inverter will toggle is it not yeah because power will be what is the unit of power it is about the kind of charge consumed per second is it not it could be some measure of what is consumed per unit time yes so what are we talking about we're talking about number of times the toggling is happening so frequency has a very important role to play and associated with it is something called activity factor so we'll just come to those aspects but instantaneous power is also dependent then on frequency of operation if you want to limit the instantaneous power so that your eye drops reduce you have to reduce the frequency of operation for example okay so as a designer you are interested in all three of them okay and in terms of how to represent power the power dissipated in the resistance is i square r and we know that the you know charge stored on a capacitor energy stored on a capacitor is 1 by 2 cv square this is basic electronics that all of you know am i right yes sir okay so for us we said that there are two primary sources of power dissipation dynamic and static the dynamic we said there are two components which which involve load capacitances and the other component which is short circuit current static power we said there are again multiple components sub threshold decays the ids kind of current gate leakage and then also junction leakage okay and now we will look into all these different parts in a little detail through this we will you know for both for dynamic power and for static power we will assume that we are talking about a chip with one billion transistors okay of these one billion transistors so this is a typical chip a typical digital chip let us say and of these one billion transistors you will notice that 950 million transistors are related to memory cells and 50 million transistors are logic transistors so in this course we are primarily talking about this part for the memory part we have this other course memory design and test that we will have in the next semester so but we are saying that there are 50 million logic transistors with an average width of 12 lambda lambda let us say is the minimum width or minimum size that you can make in a particular technology and we are also saying activity factor of 0.1 okay and then for the memory we are saying that memory devices because they are so large in number we want to keep them to be small memory array has devices which are averagely at four lambda size and because memory is so huge the activity factor is also actually lesser the probability that a particular memory would be accessed is actually lower then we are talking about 1 volt 6 65 nanometer process and we say that the gate capacitance is something like one fento farad per micron and diffusion capacitance is something like point eight centifarad per micron these are assumptions okay so when we do some uh calculations going further in the next few slides we will be going with these assumptions is that okay so it's exactly what so you assume that there are one one billion transistors on a chip we have assumed that 50 million of those are logic transistors we have assumed that the average width of those transistors logic transistors is 12 lambda and so on so all these are assumptions answers to c is what is capacity involving does it represent 65 nanometer uh you can't say that you you want to consider it like that then 2 lambda is 65 nanometer but it's not exactly the case today there's nothing like so in advanced technologies lambda has lost its significance so long back long long back lambda used to mean half the half the pitch so yes uh something like 65 nanometer for such dynamic technology but that may not be the case so just assume there is some lambda some constant okay the key point is that the logic transistors are typically three times bigger than the memory transistors just just uh consider this as an assumption that we have made it's not a very far-fetched assumption though it's a very realistic assumption but an assumption nevertheless,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2wwYMU-emI,"Link:

Transcript: okay okay so now we come to the uh today's session so so to say which is power distribution so what do you understand by the term power dissipation cv square cv square that is all about power dissipation but the first thing that comes into mind is that the first thing that comes to your mind is cv square okay so you say that there is some power that is consumed uh when the operation is happening so that essentially is dynamic power where you say okay this is something linked to cv square let us say hello okay and then what about uh short circuit currents what the short circuit current so is that we observed like with that observed during the in the uh static analysis analysis that there is a point when both are on both are in the saturation and there is a direction so it is this when the short circuit path exists between vdd and ground between the supply rails during the switching operation that is what is called as short circuit current and the third component of power is leakage the one that we were just happening about so dynamic power consumption if i said it is cv square huh so actually it's proportional to cv square it's not cv square but it's proportional to cv square so the power so but before we go into what it is let us just also have a look at power as it is drawn from the voltage source so power when you talk of it in terms of instantaneous power would be characterized as i t into vt that is current at any given point of time into the voltage at that point of time energy is integration of that power over time over the entire cycle and average power is then normalized energy over time what are you interested in as a designer what do you think is quoted on the data sheet so there are two questions after considering the complete so we should be more concerned about the dynamic power so this is all about dynamic so dynamic power is one component of it from it ibm those components that we are not even at those components yet we are saying amongst these three things instantaneous power energy and average power what are you most interested in sir uh i think it should be instantaneous power sir uh because we we must be much precise about the current which we are flowing at a particular instant in our transfer or something why because uh however in the average power we somehow get to reduce the whole value to a particular point but in instantaneous power uh it might happen like sometimes the voltage is low and the current is high so that this high current might not i mean like they uh totally collapse our circuit okay so what vaishnav is saying is that i'm also interested in instantaneous power in fact he's saying i'm only interested in instantaneous power because that gives me an estimate of what kind of current is flowing and with that i can design my power grid the current should not be so high that my power grid collapses so somewhere i am interested in instantaneous power because it will give me an estimate of what kind of ir drop can happen so i am interested in instantaneous power but when i am making a product i am also interested in energy that is what is the total energy consumed for example in one calculation so that i can then prolong the life of a calculator to run you know one million calculations before the battery dies off because i have a very small battery pencil battery there and filling button battery there and average power why do you think average power is important why is it even there on this screen there sir to calculate our consumptions at last i'm like at the end of

assumption though it's a very realistic assumption but an assumption nevertheless"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,aiJuk-YjTmY,uh we have such assumptions in place okay finally so we will simulate and we will characterize okay so let's come to Dynamic power so one thing that we need to understand is or what you already agreed on is that the energy stored in a capacitor is one by two cvd square am I right hello we've already agreed on this yes sir so however the energy drawn from the supply is if you want to charge this capacitor from 0 to vdd the energy that is drawn from the supply is something like this so what has happened only half the energy that was expended has been saved has been put on the capacitor has been conserved in the capacitor the remaining half has been dissipated in the resistance the tunnel resistance of the mosfet are you able to see this yes so now when this capacitor CS which is from 1 to 0 now that remaining 1 by 2 c v d d square will also get dissipated where will it get dissipated in the channel of the nbos are you able to see this hello foreign yes sir I into vdd into DT I should be input currents sorry I I of T should be input current right sir and like if you are if you are talking about the energy drawn from the supply yeah so we are we are modeling that input current as the the rate of charging of the capacitor it is rate of change of uh charge on the capacitor but the capacitor is our output capacitor itself yeah yeah but that is what you are charging now so here uh input input vdd is that vdd or our input V in because I can't see any connection between input and output directly so that my current can flow so does the current flow between input and output in a mosfet no sir why should there be a direct connection sir yes sir my doubt is that here the uh drawn from the supply Supply means VD directly yes okay okay okay sir thank you yeah that was my love yes yeah so if you look at the waveforms you know suppose you gave this kind of an input um so you've all done these inverter simulations all of you have done just now look at go back and look at your waveforms there if this is the kind of input you will see that the output is you know something not exactly that sharp you seen that yes and now if you plot the current through the pmos and the current through the nmos you will see that uh pmos and nmos have currents at the peaks of currents at different times over here there is a small short circuit current topic but largely then the current is Flowing from the nmos when the output is falling and from the pmos and the output is rising so most of the power dissipation is happening in the pmos on the rising side and nmos on the falling side huh and in terms of Uh current consumption you will see that uh the current consumption is following this kind of a purse where it is IP minus i n is being plotted over here okay and you will see that our from vdd will happen only during the price cycle but energy from vdd like because power power is consumed only during the rice cycle from vdd the vdd energy also gets consumed during the rice cycle and the energy stored in the capacitor first comes to half we did half CV Square then Falls to zero the yeah I am already there please tell me so this is below one uh the second row second column third row okay so what what is what we're plotting here is the current of the capacitor the current other capacitor is saying so this equation is not visible actually it's okay if IC is equal to IP minus i n current from the pmas minus current from the nmos nmos will take away the charge pmas will deposit the charge therefore current charging the capacitor just just the picture flow over here in this particular system we're just applying the job's law okay so so why the current is it should be maximum then should fall and then it should again fall price again why should we try if the direction has changed is it not the capacitor is discharging the direction of flow of current has changed so it will appear as negative current okay okay so it's like okay that plus M minus is charging it should be following the current should fall right because current will initially if it falling right yeah so current initially would rise and then fall okay it is once the capacitor starts to get charged the current would fall that is why current cell [Music] s so when it is dropping when it is what what that point is when the current curve is crossing the uh cutting the x axis for the first time what the point is basically when the current is in the third graph this is a second column third uh third row yeah so when it first cuts the x-axis the current curve only and then there's a time lapse and then it rises so I'm just wondering what this point is also the time lapse is the time gap between the fall and Rise of the input because at that time there is no current flowing anywhere the CMOS it's a static CMOS circuit um it's a static SEMA circuit you see that yes so in a static SEMA circuit when there is no transition happening we don't expect any current to flow yeah so that is what we are looking at there but there's no current flowing in that duration hmm is that okay let's light gone yeah it's coming give me a moment but are you able to see that in the static CMOS there is no current in the intermediate part when there is no struggling happening thank you hello so this is region I'm not able to get exciting I mean so you tell me what is happening here is there any any change in the output voltage Happening Here some voltage of capacitor voltage yeah this is the out now is there any change in output voltage happening here no sir so if there's no change in output voltage why should there be current flowing from either the pmos or the nmos yes that is what it is reflecting okay okay right okay that is zero okay okay yes okay so what essentially we are saying is that the total switching power is CVV square into frequency y frequency the number of times that the circuit switches that many toggles will happen one by two CV Square when the output Rises when the output Falls one by two will be CV square and the output Rises so per cycle CV Square and multiply it by number of times it would toggle in a in a second so frequency are you able to see this so this becomes the average Dynamic participated average switching power not Dynamic power Dynamic power will also have short circuits for internet okay so so this is what we have to do in our assignment right yes for dissipation you have to do this you have to also include the short circuit power in it but yeah okay so in a single uh clock means where we are going from 0 0 to 1 1 we have to take in account the whole current waveform and integrate with it by multiplying the voltage yes okay so what does this ssw represent so ssw represents the frequency multiplied by Alpha where Alpha is activity Factor okay for a signal that is a clock Alpha is equal to one because clock toggles 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 in every cycle but if there is a signal that switches only once per cycle Alpha would be one if there is a signal which has a glitch what would Alpha be so in one clock cycle yeah so there's a glitch in every clock cycle so what is Alpha for that particular circuit one by two as it's raising and falling uh for every rice so if any single switch any single any signal switching once meant Alpha is equal to one by two over here the signal is switching twice isn't it it is rising and then it's falling then it's one two one one let us say this glitch was spurious or not spurious and finally the output had to rise so what is Alpha 3x2 so do you realize the challenge that glitches cause so how come the 392 sir identity one transition second transition third transition yes sir all in one clock cycle so clock is here let us say this is your ideal circuit some node in your Adder circuit it had a glitch carry out let us say it had a glitch and then it Rose to one foreign what is the glitch leading to so basic Y2 Factor coming 3 is because three transition y two y will bring Y2 because every transition is one by two a clock we say Activity factor is one a clock has two transitions so every transition is one by two so see when we written if the clock signals the clock Alpha is the alpha is activity Factor but Alpha is one when we have two transitions that is yes and a clock has two transitions now in that clock period it has two transitions yes sir yeah so if I say that is Alpha that is one if I say Alpha for a clock is one then Alpha for a signal which is transitioning only once would be half yes sir and if it is a there's a signal which is transitioning thigh is because of a glitch Alpha would be if there are two Glitters then [Music] five by two okay every glitch is a is a drain on a lot of dynamic power so we do not want Glitters in our system okay glitches are a signal Integrity issue but they are also a much bigger power issue okay so looking at Short Circuit and what happens to the short circuit current when the input is toggling there is a time when both pmos and nmos are simultaneously on which is when some current would flow from vdd to ground directly that is short circuit current this current is no longer talk about we're not talking about CL over here we're talking about directly vdd to ground we are talking it calling out as ivd now if the rise and fall times are good then we can limit this short circuit power to less than 10 percent of total Dynamic power and therefore for back of the envelope calculations we can ignore this component but when you simulate you have to integrate you you will anyway integrate it it will get added there but for backup another calculations you can ignore this component is that okay rajneesh so sir when this V out is charging uh from vdd via the pmos this short circuit glitch will occur and similarly when V out is the CL is discharging via the below nmos then another this short circuit glitch will occur super transistor this um so what we learned in the previous slide in the activity Factor this that glist thing that this is the same thing now with activity Factor one so for every transition there will be the short circuit current also that will flow there is a charging current for load that we talked about in the previous section that will definitely be there but this short circuit current will also flow for every transition so uh so this short circuit glitch that Alpha c will delete that square that here for this glitch Alpha will be one so that this will be added in the total Direction this is this is independent of C uh on the capacitance yes yes sir the earlier formula will not be applied here that that is what I want to predict in your understanding that was a different topic we were talking about switching power there we are now talking about short circuit current bones together make Dynamic power okay a super transistor we have to add bison rate yes yes okay this is not dependent on capacitance it is dependent on Rise and Fall times yes okay okay yes uh Pfizer we need a rise time and fall time to be as low as possible to reduce the dissipation right yes to reduce this duration yes okay okay that is why you are given very tight specification when you were designing the first inverter in your assignment yeah yes okay so now let's look at that example we say that we look at that one billion times the chip we know that to calculate power we need to estimate some capacitance so we go ahead and do something like this for logic 50 million transistors into 12 Lambda and we said that there is this uh per Lambda the width that we're talking about is point zero to five microns that is a technology Factor and we said okay per Micron the gate capacitance was one pentofarad and dream capacitance was 0.8 so 1.8 went to farad per microns and I see that the logic capacitance is 27 nanometer nanofarad okay for the memory the devices do much more in number the size is smaller therefore the ratio is not as bad it is coming as 171 nanofarads and then we apply the dynamic power formula we are ignoring the short circuit currents as we just said we expect it to be within uh 10 percent of this Dynamic power and we say that okay overall power consumption will be around 6.1 Watts are you able to see this any questions so what is this factor of uh 25 nanometer uh per Lambda that is uh how much width do I associate with a Lambda one Lambda this is 25 nanometers so there was this question now what is this Lambda yes this is they are saying 25 nanometers is the Lambda okay okay just given the formula for that so what is this 0.1 and 0.02 in this calculation these are like equation kind of thing you tell me what were they what were we talking about when we introduced the subject uh some active factor of activity Factor the number of togglings to expect Hannah so so this 0.1 and 0.02 are the toggling factors for logic and memory separately right yes yes 0.1 is the activity factor for the logic and 0.02 is the activity factor for the sir yes sir uh as you said that if there was a glitch our activity Factor when two I'm like I'm like it increased sir but uh if we are eventually multiplying this activity factor with the frequency so sir uh if an activity if a glitch occurs then uh according according to what I can see on a graph my my time period should increase in that case sir because uh time period at a distinguished between a distinguished interval of time the waveform is repeating that you will talk about in terms of clock so how does a presence of a glitch depend on clock period like how does a glitch constrain a clock period sir frequency means I'm like a frequency I'm upgrading my my entire device at only one gigahertz now yes sir yes yes I'm operating my device at one gigahertz how much time do you think a glitch would take oh it would take okay it would take less time but okay I got confused okay sir I'll look into it sir,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiJuk-YjTmY,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiJuk-YjTmY

yeah that was my love yes yeah so if you look at the waveforms you know suppose you gave this kind of an input um so you've all done these inverter simulations all of you have done just now look at go

should we try if the direction has changed is it not the capacitor is discharging the direction of flow of current has changed so it will appear as negative current okay okay so it's like okay that plus M minus is charging it should be following the current should fall right because current will initially if it falling right yeah so current initially would rise and then fall okay it is once the capacitor starts to get charged the current would fall that is why current cell [Music] s so when it is dropping when it is what what that point is when the current curve is crossing the uh cutting the x axis for the first time what the point is basically when the current is in the third graph this is a second column third uh third row yeah so when it first cuts the x-axis the current curve only and then there's a time lapse and then it rises so I'm just wondering what this point is also the time lapse is the time gap between the fall and Rise of the input because at that time there is no current flowing anywhere the CMOS it's a static CMOS circuit um it's a static SEMA circuit you see that yes so in a static SEMA circuit when there is no transition happening we don't expect any current to flow yeah so that is what we are looking at there but there's no current flowing in that duration hmm is that okay let's light gone yeah it's coming give me a moment but are you able to see that in the static CMOS there is no current in the intermediate part when there is no struggling happening thank you hello so this is region I'm not able to get exciting I mean so you tell me what is happening here is there any any change in the output voltage Happening Here some voltage of capacitor voltage yeah this is the out now is there any change in output voltage happening here no sir so if there's no change in output voltage why should there be current flowing from either the pmos or the nmos yes that is what it is reflecting okay okay right okay that is zero okay okay yes okay so what essentially we are saying is that the total switching power is CVV square into frequency y frequency the number of times that the circuit switches that many toggles will happen one by two CV Square when the output Rises when the output Falls one by two will be CV square and the output Rises so per cycle CV Square and multiply it by number of times it would toggle in a in a second so frequency are you able to see this so this becomes the average Dynamic participated average switching power not Dynamic power Dynamic power will also have short circuits for internet okay so so this is what we have to do in our assignment right yes for dissipation you have to do this you have to also include the short circuit power in it but yeah okay so in a single uh clock means where we are going from 0 0 to 1 1 we have to take in account the whole current waveform and integrate with it by multiplying the voltage yes okay so what does this ssw represent so ssw represents the frequency multiplied by Alpha where Alpha is activity Factor okay for a signal that is a clock Alpha is equal to one because clock toggles 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 in every cycle but if there is a signal that switches only once per cycle Alpha would be one if there is a signal which has a glitch what would Alpha be so in one clock cycle yeah so there's a glitch in every clock cycle so what is Alpha for that particular circuit one by two as it's raising and falling uh for every rice so if any single switch any single any signal switching once meant Alpha is equal to one by two over here the signal is switching twice isn't it it is rising and then it's falling then it's one two one one let us say this glitch was spurious or not spurious and finally the output had to rise so what is Alpha 3x2 so do you realize the challenge that glitches cause so how come the 392 sir identity one transition second transition third transition yes sir all in one clock cycle so clock is here let us say this is your ideal circuit some node in your Adder circuit it had a glitch carry out let us say it had a glitch and then it Rose to one foreign what is the glitch leading to so basic Y2 Factor coming 3 is because three transition y two y will bring Y2 because every transition is one by two a clock we say Activity factor is one a clock has two transitions so every transition is one by two so see when we written if the clock signals the clock Alpha is the alpha is activity Factor but Alpha is one when we have two transitions that is yes and a clock has two transitions now in that clock period it has two transitions yes sir yeah so if I say that is Alpha that is one if I say Alpha for a clock is one then Alpha for a signal which is transitioning only once would be half yes sir and if it is a there's a signal which is transitioning thigh is because of a glitch Alpha would be if there are two Glitters then [Music] five by two okay every glitch is a is a drain on a lot of dynamic power so we do not want Glitters in our system okay glitches are a signal Integrity issue but they are also a much bigger power issue okay so looking at Short Circuit and what happens to the short circuit current when the input is toggling there is a time when both pmos and nmos are simultaneously on which is when some current would flow from vdd to ground directly that is short circuit current this current is no longer talk about we're not talking about CL over here we're talking about directly vdd to ground we are talking it calling out as ivd now if the rise and fall times are good then we can limit this short circuit power to less than 10 percent of total Dynamic power and therefore for back of the envelope calculations we can ignore this component but when you simulate you have to integrate you you will anyway integrate it it will get added there but for backup another calculations you can ignore this component is that okay rajneesh so sir when this V out is charging uh from vdd via the pmos this short circuit glitch will occur and similarly when V out is the CL is discharging via the below nmos then another this short circuit glitch will occur super transistor this um so what we learned in the previous slide in the activity Factor this that glist thing that this is the same thing now with activity Factor one so for every transition there will be the short circuit current also that will flow there is a charging current for load that we talked about in the previous section that will definitely be there but this short circuit current will also flow for every transition so uh so this short circuit glitch that Alpha c will delete that square that here for this glitch Alpha will be one so that this will be added in the total Direction this is this is independent of C uh on the capacitance yes yes sir the earlier formula will not be applied here that that is what I want to predict in your understanding that was a different topic we were talking about switching power there we are now talking about short circuit current bones together make Dynamic power okay a super transistor we have to add bison rate yes yes okay this is not dependent on capacitance it is dependent on Rise and Fall times yes okay okay yes uh Pfizer we need a rise time and fall time to be as low as possible to reduce the dissipation right yes to reduce this duration yes okay okay that is why you are given very tight specification when you were designing the first inverter in your assignment yeah yes okay so now let's look at that example we say that we look at that one billion times the chip we know that to calculate power we need to estimate some capacitance so we go ahead and do something like this for logic 50 million transistors into 12 Lambda and we said that there is this uh per Lambda the width that we're talking about is point zero to five microns that is a technology Factor and we said okay per Micron the gate capacitance was one pentofarad and dream capacitance was 0.8 so 1.8 went to farad per microns and I see that the logic capacitance is 27 nanometer nanofarad okay for the memory the devices do much more in number the size is smaller therefore the ratio is not as bad it is coming as 171 nanofarads and then we apply the dynamic power formula we are ignoring the short circuit currents as we just said we expect it to be within uh 10 percent of this Dynamic power and we say that okay overall power consumption will be around 6.1 Watts are you able to see this any questions so what is this factor of uh 25 nanometer uh per Lambda that is uh how much width do I associate with a Lambda one Lambda this is 25 nanometers so there was this question now what is this Lambda yes this is they are saying 25 nanometers is the Lambda okay okay just given the formula for that so what is this 0.1 and 0.02 in this calculation these are like equation kind of thing you tell me what were they what were we talking about when we introduced the subject uh some active factor of activity Factor the number of togglings to expect Hannah so so this 0.1 and 0.02 are the toggling factors for logic and memory separately right yes yes 0.1 is the activity factor for the logic and 0.02 is the activity factor for the sir yes sir uh as you said that if there was a glitch our activity Factor when two I'm like I'm like it increased sir but uh if we are eventually multiplying this activity factor with the frequency so sir uh if an activity if a glitch occurs then uh according according to what I can see on a graph my my time period should increase in that case sir because uh time period at a distinguished between a distinguished interval of time the waveform is repeating that you will talk about in terms of clock so how does a presence of a glitch depend on clock period like how does a glitch constrain a clock period sir frequency means I'm like a frequency I'm upgrading my my entire device at only one gigahertz now yes sir yes yes I'm operating my device at one gigahertz how much time do you think a glitch would take oh it would take okay it would take less time but okay I got confused okay sir I'll look into it sir"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,2FF0fRRpP38,yes okay so we can estimate from back of the null calculations what kind of power we have if we have you know estimate of activity factor and something like that are you able to see this so here in this thing we are considering activity Factor 0.1 and 0.02 we had considered some kind of If this means glitches will only be there right and after that we have calculated the activity Factor right yeah and now suppose the 6.1 is beyond our power budget our power specification said 4 Watts what do you do of these all these things what can you reduce frequency can reduce actually all the three things you can reduce activity Factor how would you reduce activity Factor you will say I will get the devices I will put nand gates in some places and enable only parts of the circuit and not other parts of the circuit so if I reduce the activity Factor per circuit I will be able to reduce power I can reduce capacitances at least the capacitance is that toggle I can use smaller devices I can operate at a lower voltage I can operate at a lower frequency all these things I can reduce to be able to reduce Dynamic power and yeah please so how we are reducing the activity Factor can you please tell me okay uh let us look at activity factor in little more detail it will become abundantly evident to you how to reduce activity Factor yes so let us look at how activity factor is estimated so let us say that there is a probability p i of a node I being equal to 1. huh so the probability of a Pi Bar then is the that is the probability of node I being equal to 0 is 1 minus pi um and activity factor is p i into Pi Bar if there is a completely random data then what happens to p any node can be 0 or it can be 1. huh for a completely random data the probability of a node being at 1 is 0.5 are you with me yes it can be it can either be zero or one so the probability of a node being 1 is 0.5 so the alpha in a completely random data is 0.25 hmm however uh data is not completely random at all times huh so what we what do we say we say that many times a data will have for example if you're talking about bank accounts uh the msvs will largely be zeros if you're talking about something else again you know mostly msvs are something that you can fairly call as zeros and also because data will propagate through and Gates and or Gates they have which have lower activity Factor we'll just see why a typical design would have an activity factor of 0.1 so why do and and or Gates have lower activity Factor just look at this let us say it's and eight and two what is the probability of an output of and two being one it is a multiplication of probability of a being 1 and the probability of B being one am I right yes so the probability of and 2 being 1 is 1 by 4. and trees output being one as one by eight and you can calculate for all the gates hmm so now if I have a chain of gates let us say huh if I have a chain of gates and I say the inputs have an activity factor of 0.5 what will be the activity Factor at uh say N1 N2 and Y can you quickly calculate and tell me what is the activity Factor at N1 what is p at N1 so one by four three by four by one by four the probability of node N1 being one is actually three by four it's not an and gate it's a nand gate yeah yes so Alpha is 3 by 16. now given that what is the probability of this output the p over here y being 1. 1 by 16 . because both the inputs have to be zero see there is a bubble over here so the activity Factor at Y is 15 by 256. much less than 0.1 actually is it not so for an and four the activity factors less than point one clearly less than 0.1 and 3 is 1 by 8.125 and so on so yes say calculations so can you just go through this calculations once so it's not duplicated tell me what is the probability of uh so N1 will be 1 when a is 0 or B is 0. am I right yes yes sir so in how many cases is a or one of them zero there are four combinations of a possible A and B possible yes sir how many cases are there where one of them will be zero three so the probability is three by four yes if p is three by four then P bar is one by four yes then Alpha is 1 by 4 into 3 by 4 3 by 16 so Alpha was a p into P bar P bar okay right yes similarly what happens over here at the inputs whatever I had p over here is converted because there is a bubble so the inputs have a probability of one by four and one by four for this and gate for the and gate the output is one when both the inputs are 1. so 1 by 4 into 1 by 4 so the probability of the output over here being 1 is 1 by 16. and then okay hmm so P into P bar becomes 15 by 256. so yes so actually we have two bubbles like after that so we can just cancel them out right like for finding one directly we can just say like uh we are going directly and just it will be right so see we've gone through this because I can give you any circuit and you have to find the activity Factor there can I not yeah so I want you to get some practice on that that's why we did this okay sir okay yes sir what is the two input gates are different sir unless here we have an a nand gate so what if we have a nor gate or something yeah do it you will find out but it's not a hypothetical question just do it solve it in the second stacer when we get uh the probability over here would be different I'm like yeah the number would be 3 by 24 something would come let it come just do it no just solve it why are you worried is the method clear yes yes you apply the method so this will last me 15 minutes what is the probability of Y being zero 15 16 15. so P into P virus okay right okay there's niche sir uh sir suppose if in the top land after the top land we add a same two input nine after that means just the inverter after that so sir this three by four will become one by four just simple yeah yes that's what the bubble means no that's what the bubble represents okay okay yes yes but the activity Factor will still continue to be yes oh no yes sorry any node yes Alpha for any node is p into P bar always yes that is the formula probability of a node being equal to one has been called as p ragoff okay it would depend on its inputs yes Pfizer if it's an oriented in place of this you tell me yeah so for an or gate in how many cases will the output be one if a and b were three by four so yes that is what it is then I know you have the answer is yes okay okay Vishal so sir if we change like uh these and and nand gates to and Gates uh will the alpha change or I think it will be same right if I would remain actually same yeah there is just one inverter missing now yeah so sir it will verify is basically depending on the probability of it being and it not being associated as simple as it is as simple as the G concept The Logical effort Concepts that we looked at what is The Logical effort of a gate g is independent of the size of the gate yeah so if the topology if the functionality is of ending now whether you put an ad or not put an inverter there or not because the functionality is landing the kind of alpha Factor would be like this only okay okay so what do you do you say that to reduce the activity factor I will put an enable logic such that uh when the enable logic is let us say zero the output there will not double so if the output doesn't toggle I say power okay so Club gating is done to reduce so reduce activity Factor so that you save power then how do you reduce capacitance by you know the logical effort method we reduce uh the number of stages we use smaller Gates uh we do good floor planning so that wire capacitance reduces uh we also discussed that for long for large capacitances have the complex gates in the beginning and buffers or inverters in the end so that you do not toggle complex Gates too much or the complex gates are not very large in size hmm so all these things that we did for the logical effort method can be applied here again to reduce overall capacitances in your circuit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FF0fRRpP38,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FF0fRRpP38

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,Nve0FZCx7gk,now this is the concept of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling so all of you have your cell phone with you am I right some of you might actually be attending this class on a cell phone any one of you attending the class on a cell phone as of now okay not here yet but someone would be at times so do you think the cell phone application processor here it has a rated frequency of 2.5 gigahertz do you think it always operates at 2.5 gigahertz huh so when you are playing a game on a cell phone when you are doing some really CPU intensive stuff at that point of time you need 2.5 gigahertz but if you're just reading some text message browsing the internet regular text pages you don't need that high performance the system does not need that so what does the system do system says that oh let us reduce the frequency of operation the load on my CPU is not as much instead of 2 gigahertz let me operate at only 200 megahertz I have reduced Dynamic power consumption by 10 times that is dynamic frequency scaling hmm now if I'm operating at 200 megahertz for let us say past one minute the system says that probably I don't really need to go into very high frequency for us for some more time now so let me also lower the voltage of operation because for 200 megahertz as you know at low voltages I can have larger delays but I at 200 megahertz I will still be able to meet my performance of 200 megahertz at let us say 0.7 volts I don't need 1.2 volts so I reduce vdd from 1.2 to something like 0.7 what happens so I first reduce frequency and then I reduce voltage also and I saved much more power because it was one by two CV Square f reduction in F led to linear reduction in power reduction in V additionally led to quadratic reduction in power and by managing both V and F I reduced power cubically so yes so this voltage killing I mean I get that if we reduce that we we save on power so but like how can I reduce that b in this figure what we are showing is that there is a voltage regulator that we add into our system by there is we add a controller in our system which we call as a dynamic voltage scaling controller which observes the workload and the temperature if the temperature goes very high it says my temperature is going very high my package May melt I need to reduce power consumption it would say Okay reduce frequency reduce voltage reduce voltage by telling the voltage regulator that you have to reduce the voltage huh now in another case when the workload is very less you're just browsing internet at a very slow pace you're reading some text periods it says I don't need to operate at a very high frequency the workload is very less reduce frequency reduce voltage so that is how we will be able to do it so sir when the situation kind of arises that I can reduce my frequency then only I can think of what is scaling right yes because the voltage will brought it in a single radio increase the delays also yeah yeah so that is where we said now we will start first reduce frequency we'll observe if we can operate at that low frequency for a reasonable amount of time then we will assume that okay if if we are not required to be at a higher frequency for the past to let us say uh one second I can also reduce voltage okay so but that will also impact our frequency in a certain way so I was already operating at a lower frequency is it not okay okay so earlier I had only scaled the frequency but not the voltage so I'm I'm basically making it so that is consistent with that frequency yes okay and to be able to do this you will need circuits which are called as level shifters because now there is a high voltage domain there is a low voltage domain and you will need to have level shifting happening between them otherwise there will be short circuit currents are you able to see this yes Michelle so sir if if somehow like we are using like we are doing something which needs more like which is more intensive which you need more so what will happen first we increase the voltage first or we increase the frequency first you tell me so I think uh it should be like we'll increase the voltage first and then we'll increase the frequency because if I directly increase the frequency without increasing the voltage what happens there will be some race conditions which will fail okay yeah so system will fail yeah okay okay so which conditions I'm sorry so when you raise the frequency before the voltage which conditions you create yourself race conditions set up time whole time something familiar will fail because their system is slow it's it's at low voltage but you want to operate at a much faster rate so something some outputs will not come in time something will go wrong okay yeah voltage and then the frequency okay so by increasing voltage we are making the device faster than the settings yes I know so you see you you realize why it was important to understand impact of voltage on delays before we talk about dvfs listen that was why that was the previous session and not this one okay so what we have done today we've looked at Dynamic power consumption being made of two components switching power and short circuit power and we have set that to reduce switching power you could use uh you could reduce all the various things you could reduce activity Factor by you know preventing glitches by propagating by using and nand Gates and so on we said that you can reduce capacitance by using smaller devices uh doing smarter placement so that wire capacitance is also reduce and so on and we said you could also do voltage and frequency scaling Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling okay and then to reduce short circuit power you would you would have good transition slopes is that okay so with that we will close today's session and the next session we will start with a static,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nve0FZCx7gk,"Link:

higher frequency for the past to let us say uh one second I can also reduce voltage okay so but that will also impact our frequency in a certain way so I was already operating at a lower frequency is it not okay okay so earlier I had only scaled the frequency but not the voltage so I'm I'm basically making it so that is consistent with that frequency yes okay and to be able to do this you will need circuits which are called as level shifters because now there is a high voltage domain there is a low voltage domain and you will need to have level shifting happening between them otherwise there will be short circuit currents are you able to see this yes Michelle so sir if if somehow like we are using like we are doing something which needs more like which is more intensive which you need more so what will happen first we increase the voltage first or we increase the frequency first you tell me so I think uh it should be like we'll increase the voltage first and then we'll increase the frequency because if I directly increase the frequency without increasing the voltage what happens there will be some race conditions which will fail okay yeah so system will fail yeah okay okay so which conditions I'm sorry so when you raise the frequency before the voltage which conditions you create yourself race conditions set up time whole time something familiar will fail because their system is slow it's it's at low voltage but you want to operate at a much faster rate so something some outputs will not come in time something will go wrong okay yeah voltage and then the frequency okay so by increasing voltage we are making the device faster than the settings yes I know so you see you you realize why it was important to understand impact of voltage on delays before we talk about dvfs listen that was why that was the previous session and not this one okay so what we have done today we've looked at Dynamic power consumption being made of two components switching power and short circuit power and we have set that to reduce switching power you could use uh you could reduce all the various things you could reduce activity Factor by you know preventing glitches by propagating by using and nand Gates and so on we said that you can reduce capacitance by using smaller devices uh doing smarter placement so that wire capacitance is also reduce and so on and we said you could also do voltage and frequency scaling Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling okay and then to reduce short circuit power you would you would have good transition slopes is that okay so with that we will close today's session and the next session we will start with a static"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,zFqb41NmdEU,on the previous class then we can take it upright away okay so what do you mean by static power dissipation so when input is stable nothing is changing and that at that point of time there might be some leakage so static power is when there is no change in input everything is stable even then some power is getting consumed see in cmos we said that uh so we will do it in much more detail later also but in cmos inverter we saw that in a stable state there is no on current neither from the nmos nor from the pmos because of the the fact that the nmos either one of the nmos or the pmos will be on both will not be on in a stable state during transition something would happen but otherwise in a stable state only one of them would be on so there is no direct variety to ground path and we do not expect any current to flow but some current still flows and that is called as static current or static power or leakage different ways to call it so what do you mean by that no change in input i mean why would that condition occur i mean so you tell me i just transition from zero to one and the next cycle will come after two nanoseconds yes so what happens in the in this duration okay uh so one of the inputs would be stable at least yeah one of them we're just talking about an inverter it only has one input so the input is stable no input is toggling but even then some current will flow okay so the amount of that current will be much larger in a cmos that current will be lesser but the current will flow okay and all right so that is called as static current but the path would be there any time the current some current would be flowing because of that uh whatever the store whatever the whatever was stored in the capacitor so that way that would flow then there is no change so let us say for example give me then let us say for example there is this inverter now let us say the stores are vdd now the input is 0 where is the path there is a path here but then uh this both the drain angles are on vdd so the current vds is zero current is zero there is no one current in the system as of now isn't it so okay we are talking terms of inverting right now yeah the meeting is getting recorded okay no sir we are talking in terms of the inverter lecture sir i did not get how are we reducing activity factor by uh putting our complex logic in the beginning because my idea was that because the clock will enter the complex logic at the beginning itself so most toggling would be faced at that point reducing activities after by putting the complex logic in the beginning with the function okay you're simply reducing the overall area and capacitances by doing that so that is already not related to activity factor at all no it's like anything i okay okay sorry okay yeah so coming to static power let us refresh about the uh you know one billion transactions that we were talking about where we said that uh there were one million 1 billion transistors of which 95 percent was memories and remaining was logic and so on remember that case then we studied for the dynamic power in the last session [Music] yes there we are nothing sir you were asking them i said yes okay okay so uh now we are just adding in some more details so that we can estimate the leakage of that chip also we are saying that uh the normal vt the leakage current in the normal vt device is hundred nano ampere 12 millimeter and that of a high vt device is 10 nanometers per millimeter and that hpt devices are used in all the memories and 95 percent of logic gates are also high vp there is some gate leakage which is 5 nano amperes per millimeter and then junction leakage which we say is negligible as of now because we are not applying any body bias or anything like that okay so just remember these things so that when we want to estimate the leakage accept level you will know where to and how to arrive at it is that okay so we said that width of normal v2 devices 50 million devices are normal vp their length is 12 lambda we know that lambda is 0.025 by lambda and uh we we just saw that uh the what was the 0.54 just give me a minute yeah these are total devices and 95 of devices were hvt so 5 of devices are normal vt so normal vt the total width that you get is 0.75 into 10 raised to power 6 microns similarly you calculate for high vt devices 15 50 50 million logic devices 12 lambda 95 of logic devices are high vt then all the memory devices are high vt and we multiply with the lambda factor so we get the overall width for the hpt devices also we've also been given the current per width for hpt on a svt device for a normal vt device and we can simply estimate that uh why do you think we are divided by two over here so to get the average no we don't need to do average of 5 et normal vt they are simply being added this 2 is because of something else so pmos and nmos will not have the same amount of leakage at same point of time so what we are saying is that in a cmos logic either pmos is off or nmos is off so only one of them is leaking the other one is not leaking at all because it is on so this doesn't make sense here i mean in an inverter one the one that we just saw in the over there uh when the input is zero and the output is one which of the two devices is leaking are both of them leaking nmos cannot leak i think suppose no inverse cannot be why will the envelopes not leak so i mean it is there is no path to ground so where will the current go in so what does leakage mean when there is no action happening then some current is flowing when a device is off yes when a device is off so there is no evident path for on current yeah but well then some current is flowing that is why it is called as off current yeah so which of the two devices is off over here nmos so in fact nmos is leaking yes and the b mass is not leaking so but pmos also there's no current going after it has reached that yeah but it is on you will not call that as leakage current okay okay anna so in a static condition the pmos will not govern the amount of current that is flowing through it the n mass will govern the amount of current that will flow through the pmos also is it not applying simple christopher's law i mean sir you're saying that uh when this end mass is off so though there is no on current path but still there is some path that will be the cause of leaking and that will provide the whole connection for the current from pmos also to sync through that uh npcmos is on pmos wants to sing this kind of current huge correct yes sir n mass is off yes nmr says no no current can flow from me i will uh i will flow only very small current from myself i'm not able to draw it on the screen so that is what the nmos would say yes what happens but due to some junction getting overlap with some kind of overlap there is some path provided by anyone there is some path but let us apply kirchhoff's law over there yes yes what happens uh the overall current that can flow from the p mass is limited to the current that will flow from the n mass yes we must cannot supply more current than the nmos constraint but behave we would be considering the current from the capacitor also right now or just see the capacitor is charged at vdd so if the pmos has to so if the capacitor cannot source current from itself can it no no so if nmos is to sink any current and pmos is ready to give so much of current will the current come from the capacitor or from the pmos okay yeah yeah vmos will not allow itself because it will maintain the world yeah okay yes sir either sub uh just appear just for the clarification when we are talking about the high vt devices those are the memory devices right like uh no logic devices can also be high vt so how we are how we are distributing between like 95 percent will be high vts and the five percent why is that that is uh that is the design of our chip okay okay okay okay and one more thing sir uh i am quite about confused between gate leakage and junction leakage [Music] that we have these many devices and these devices just give me a moment my system is slowing down a bit just give me a moment um sir yes sir so to find leakage currency it's enough to find the current flowing through idd at a point where my output is high uh what do you mean okay yes sir i i'll repeat it again so to find leakage current it's and then i can uh find the current i'm like in either or something i'll be finding that i'll be getting the wave of the current so uh i'll be just measuring this wave where my output is high that gives me my leakage current is is this statement correct sir why leakage will happen even when the output is low [Music] when my vdd is high i'll be making i'll take kcl over there and as my capacitance is fully charged and my pmos is ready to supply much more sir i'm sorry sir i can't hear you sorry i'm asking is will uh well will kcl apply only when the output is high or will kcl apply even when output is low even when output is closer so even an output is low input is high even then you will have the same method of calculating leakage does that when the output is low it means input is high it means pmos is off so pmos will govern the leakage not the nmos can't charge over vdd so will there be any kind of current over there because my output is at vdd it might be a tweeted or less than vdd but it won't go vts is zero if radius is zero there is no on current anna yes sir videos of the radius for the p mass is zero that is what you are saying output is vdd and supply is also vdd yes sir yes sir drainant source both are at zero hmm we did yeah so there is nowhere on current yes but the premise is it can offer as much current as you want okay so this is a generalization for only as much current as most things it will not be able to sync any more current okay this is a generalized statement but for inverter it uh inverter has when pmos is on and mass will be off so it will there won't arise a condition like that in any sigma circuit if the nmr stack is off the pmos track is on or vice versa yes cmos yes sir yes so sir like uh can i say that key uh the source for the though the path is provided by the off device but the source ultimately is the voltage source basically for the leakage current also even it is drawn from the source itself yeah yeah okay so yes the current current will always come from any current would always come from supply no yeah it couldn't come from anywhere else even if it was a capacitor that was charged some time back that current had also come from the supply yes sir yes sir yeah somebody yeah you will be able to link it to supply from somewhere anyways you will be able to do that yes yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFqb41NmdEU,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFqb41NmdEU

had also come from the supply yes sir yes sir yeah somebody yeah you will be able to link it to supply from somewhere anyways you will be able to do that yes yeah"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,BIbkHKBmrrQ,[Music] sir just one thing in the current part if we have let's say our two input nand gate then what will come in the denominator even then it will be two in a two input nand gate one of the p masses will be off suppose 0 1 is the state of input so one of the p masses is off the other one is on and one of the n masses is off and other one is on any time half the p masses and half the n mosses are on and off yes yeah so there was a question as to what what causes this leakage and so on so there are multiple sources of leakage the first and most important source is sub threshold conduction what does it mean it says that transistors cannot abruptly turn off as you so it does not happen that as soon as you go below vp transistor is completely off we saw that ids characteristics where we had talked about sub threshold slope and so on and this is log and we had said that the slope has to be 70 millivolts per decade and so on you remember that 60 millivolt per decade and all that stuff yes so what you're talking about there we were saying that it is not that vt can each a current goes to zero at once okay it reduces very very significantly there is a logarithmic exponential reduction in current as you go below vt but current will still flow and that is what is a threshold conduction okay then another set of leakage is gate leakage which is tunneling through ultra thin gate dielectrics so even though we are now using high k metal gate dielectrics which are physically not as thin as silicon dioxide based gates would be but even then the effective thickness of the gate is effectively the physical thickness of the gate is the order of uh you know two nanometers or three nanometers not more than that uh in in technologies where we do not have high k metal gates in those technologies because you want effective gate oxide thickness to be less than you know 20 angstroms 10 angstroms and so on uh there is a lot of tunnelling current that can flow and that is what is gate leakage and then we have junction leakage which is that there are reverse biased pn junctions in our devices so where where all do we have reverse biased pn junctions that's forced to body and drain two body junctions yes source to body drain to body both are reverse bias junctions and even though they are reverse bias functions reverse bias junctions do also conduct some current so that is where we have junction leakage we will look into these in a little more detail and their impact on how we design so sub threshold leakage as we just saw is uh is the current that is still flowing after vt has like after your device has gone below vt so this is what is defined as vt in this particular graph and you see there is still some current flowing even at zero value there is some current flowing so that is what we call as sub threshold current ids in a in a very very good transistor in a very very good transistor this sub threshold slope would tend to 60 to 65 millivolts per decade okay why why is this 60 millivolts per decade preferable over 100 millivolt per decade i'm sorry so it is the best that silicon can achieve and also my question is not why 60 i'm saying why lower is better sir decade the id will decrease per decade below we want current to decrease faster because current current will reduce much faster as you reduce the voltage there will be a decade of current reduction within whatever number we have if it's a hundred millivolts per decade then it requires 100 millivolts slower than vp to get one tenth the current whereas if it is 65 millivolt per decade it means my device has turned off very quickly and even 65 millivolts below vt i will have one tenth the current yeah welcome when we were discussing the boss capacitance and then we move to the there was when we were discussing the first time you told us about sub threshold you were seeing that one is that there is a depletion with under the gate and then there is a depletion of the pn junctions of the source and drain so somehow they get connected and that is basically providing a path so that is the path for that uh this sub threshold leakage i mean i just wanted to confirm yeah so let us go a little little beyond what we were talking on in the last class also or possibly in the last office hours uh where we were discussing about availability of electrons in the conduction band so do we realize that at all times at room temperature there will be some electrons in the conduction band yes sir so there's an electric field applied somewhere those electrons will flow yes so that is leakage even if the device is off there would be something in the conduction band okay anna so but i mean uh i'm not able to clearly visualize the path exactly what the though the band theory tells us me that they will be leakage because every any time point of time they would be conducting electrons but that part i'm i'm just just flexing about the path yeah subthreshold means source to drain path okay but that path is provided by the depletion connections and um no not exactly so depletion definitely depletion depletion region is a so what is the difference between a depletion region and a regular substrate so i mean depletion means that what the nature of the substrate was you have avoid the excess carriers from that region basically so in depletion region all the excess carriers have been depleted yes sir so if you if you inject some electrons from one side because there are no other carriers and there is an electric field across the depletion region these electrons will move very quickly across the depletion region that is one aspect but uh there may not be a complete depletion region also formed there okay okay okay so probably when we go into an accumulation mode then we can say that there is a different kind of a current flowing but uh so because like i am able to visualize depletion region as a like very very high resistance kind of region i mean it's a pistons are too much unlike creator so that may be the limiting factor i i can't comment okay okay yes yeah in the first formula can you repeat the terms in the exponential because i mean it's a little blurry uh the terms in the exponential are v g s minus v t naught minus eta vds minus a gamma uh vsb so you have all these things in the book available don't worry about it i'm not going to ask you these formulae in the exams or any and no one not you will not be asking someone even in the in the interview don't worry about that and so what's the difference between vt and vt not okay so v capital t v capital t is the kt by cube component oh okay right so pd knowledge is a sub threshold voltage vt naught is the threshold voltage at 0 vds okay so [Music] [Applause] again there is some issue so we are saying that there is a sub threshold current that is flowing and that sub threshold current is dependent on vp threshold voltage that is also if the threshold voltage is lower the sub threshold current will be higher we say we are also saying that this sub threshold current is also dependent on uh the the relationship between uh source and body uh the the body bias voltage that has been applied we're also saying that the sub threshold voltage this sub threshold current is also dependent on temperature by the virtue of this component 80 by q um as temperature increases kt by q also increases so we're also saying that this subthreshold current is dependent on temperature so uh when we say that the vt of the device has changed what has happened is that uh if if you for example you change vt from 0.4 to 0.1 the the same curve when it is shifted to the left would intersect the vt the vdd or the gate input vn equal to zero axis at a different place and therefore you can have multiple decades of difference between a high weighted the leakage of a highway device and the off current of a low vt device so this is just an exemplification that you you reduced in in 65 nanometers as you reduce vt by a hundred millivolts you increase the off current by a decade because we assume that the substantial slope is 100 intervals per decade okay now we come to some other effects which are slightly nuanced but are important so one effect is drain induced barrier lowering what does this mean this means that when i apply v when i change so see typically the leakage phenomena is dependent on gate pickup voltage what is the voltage at gate and when it is off even then some current is flowing from source to drain some electron flow is happening from source to drain so that is your typical leakage definition however what happens uh there is a voltage on drain and source also that is applied and we see that there is a dependence of on current and off current on current obviously but also off current on a leakage at we did equal to zero this happens because as you increase the drain voltage the electric field contours change in such a way that uh you know okay in a long channel device what i are why is this happening today just give me a moment so first tell me you understand the difference between a long channel device and a short channel device no yes sir so what is the difference so we uh i mean the uh we reach voltage i mean the velocity saturation more quickly quickly for channel devices so you have a lower current i mean in saturation so okay so as the technology scaling happens as you use shorter length what starts to happen is that your device behaves differently than the standard you know set of equations uh that we studied till now okay this deviation and behavior is referred to as short channel effects okay and uh why do these effects happen we will look at it in in and this explanation that i am just about to start with you so let us say this is a big long channel device and over here i have a short channel device okay now in a long channel device let us say vd is uh one or two volts and vs zero so what happens uh there is this barrier between drain and source so there is a depletion width over here there is a depletion width over here and in between there is a barrier if i try to draw that barrier that barrier would look like this so what is happening this two volts that i had over here is dropping across the channel so as i move from drain side to source side this barrier is increasing if i have a higher voltage over here current should be electrons will be attracted over here now in a long channel device this barrier so electrons have to jump from source into this region so this barrier remains high however in a short channel device what happens is that as drain tends to come closer we see that the barrier reduces when this barrier reduces what happens more electrons can now flow so for a short channel device let us look at it in a separate graph for a short center device the drain and source are closer and the barrier over here reduces than this value so electrons can now more easily jump and reach the drain this is called as drain induced barrier lowering this happens because over here we saw that depletion regions were far apart whereas in short channel devices depletion regions actually start to come very close to each other as they start to come close to each other the barrier starts to reduce questions so what is this is this some energy barrier or some physical barrier today yeah this is the energy this is the conduction band that i have shown uh so here we assume that the depletion of drain and the swords in long channel have reached their maximum depth even if how much ever the video is raised in long channel so the source and drain this junction this is the junction property this is not again talking about the gate over here i am talking about yeah i am talking about this the junction junction only for moga there will be some depletion wait form and uh uh then we have this voltage applied due to which this solution would have changed already yes we're talking about a static condition okay okay so we are not in okay i thought that if we increase vd maybe we can uh uh we can achieve the ibl in long term also uh no no never okay sir yes sir so this condition which you are we were we are speaking right now is in the uh is during my transistor is off right yes so sir if my transistor is off then obviously my depletion region would be above because there is no inversion inversion layer over there i didn't understand why this depletion region moved a bit up diffusion region there is no depletion region also here rashford depletion region there no but okay sorry yes sir i know [Music] we are getting from sir exactly is it due to drain and source yeah that is the pn junction okay okay let's go thank you okay this is the energy conduction band diagram but how is this a financial magnet which looks like some physical structure um so let me if i if i simply move this just a minute swat on it now and so are you able to see this now let me also put this here hello yeah are you able to see this that is what i am saying that's it because it's 2 volts over here the overall energy is lower over here and because uh it's high over there this this in fact the source source would be the since sources are zero this energy would be appearing higher but there is this barrier and we this vd over here the change in depletion width that is called that it causes does not impact anything on the values on the source side whereas when you apply a high vd over here it causes a change in depletion width in such a manner that the source also starts to get impacted and therefore the barrier reduces sir why did the vd become high sir because you charge the capacitor in an inverter you charge the capacitor to vdd yes sir yes right so you change the read and you change the vdna yes sir okay so so even when the like uh vgs was less than dt but still that there would be a depletion under the gate also now so but we have not considered that in this uh there would be a depletion another gate at all times there is some bgs i mean there will be some kind of yeah there will be some depletion but when so there would be a point where there will be no depletion also so we are not really talking about whether there is a depletion there or not what we are saying is that the drain voltage and the impact of drain voltage on the depletion layer starts to impact the starts to impact the barrier on the source side also so sir like it's like uh in short you're seeing that when uh in the short channel devices when we there is a change in the voltage on the vd so that changes depletion at the dairy but that also in effect changes at the source so the so it changes the barrier at the source and therefore leakage current changes and that is what is called as zone induced barrier lowering okay okay so high rain voltage causes current to increase and that is what you are seeing in this red region over here sir yes sir uh so now as uh someone already asked so we were speaking about nmos previously and my nmos will be off when my input will be zero yeah right sir so input is nothing but we are giving it to gate so i don't see any kind of depletion region forming over there because my gate voltage is zero uh but the voltage that i have applied at gate is zero but the doping that i could have done on the gate or the metal that i would have used for the gate can still pin it in such a value that there could be a depletion region yeah you can study so this is all ssd you can read that there and you will find out okay so now that was uh the ibl then there is another effect which is called as body effect where we,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIbkHKBmrrQ,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIbkHKBmrrQ
Transcript: [Music] sir just one thing in the current part if we have let's say our two input nand gate then what will come in the denominator even then it will be two in a two input nand gate one of the p masses will be off suppose 0 1 is the state of input so one of the p masses is off the other one is on and one of the n masses is off and other one is on any time half the p masses and half the n mosses are on and off yes yeah so there was a question as to what what causes this leakage and so on so there are multiple sources of leakage the first and most important source is sub threshold conduction what does it mean it says that transistors cannot abruptly turn off as you so it does not happen that as soon as you go below vp transistor is completely off we saw that ids characteristics where we had talked about sub threshold slope and so on and this is log and we had said that the slope has to be 70 millivolts per decade and so on you remember that 60 millivolt per decade and all that stuff yes so what you're talking about there we were saying that it is not that vt can each a current goes to zero at once okay it reduces very very significantly there is a logarithmic exponential reduction in current as you go below vt but current will still flow and that is what is a threshold conduction okay then another set of leakage is gate leakage which is tunneling through ultra thin gate dielectrics so even though we are now using high k metal gate dielectrics which are physically not as thin as silicon dioxide based gates would be but even then the effective thickness of the gate is effectively the physical thickness of the gate is the order of uh you know two nanometers or three nanometers not more than that uh in in technologies where we do not have high k metal gates in those technologies because you want effective gate oxide thickness to be less than you know 20 angstroms 10 angstroms and so on uh there is a lot of tunnelling current that can flow and that is what is gate leakage and then we have junction leakage which is that there are reverse biased pn junctions in our devices so where where all do we have reverse biased pn junctions that's forced to body and drain two body junctions yes source to body drain to body both are reverse bias junctions and even though they are reverse bias functions reverse bias junctions do also conduct some current so that is where we have junction leakage we will look into these in a little more detail and their impact on how we design so sub threshold leakage as we just saw is uh is the current that is still flowing after vt has like after your device has gone below vt so this is what is defined as vt in this particular graph and you see there is still some current flowing even at zero value there is some current flowing so that is what we call as sub threshold current ids in a in a very very good transistor in a very very good transistor this sub threshold slope would tend to 60 to 65 millivolts per decade okay why why is this 60 millivolts per decade preferable over 100 millivolt per decade i'm sorry so it is the best that silicon can achieve and also my question is not why 60 i'm saying why lower is better sir decade the id will decrease per decade below we want current to decrease faster because current current will reduce much faster as you reduce the voltage there will be a decade of current reduction within whatever number we have if it's a hundred millivolts per decade then it requires 100 millivolts slower than vp to get one tenth the current whereas if it is 65 millivolt per decade it means my device has turned off very quickly and even 65 millivolts below vt i will have one tenth the current yeah welcome when we were discussing the boss capacitance and then we move to the there was when we were discussing the first time you told us about sub threshold you were seeing that one is that there is a depletion with under the gate and then there is a depletion of the pn junctions of the source and drain so somehow they get connected and that is basically providing a path so that is the path for that uh this sub threshold leakage i mean i just wanted to confirm yeah so let us go a little little beyond what we were talking on in the last class also or possibly in the last office hours uh where we were discussing about availability of electrons in the conduction band so do we realize that at all times at room temperature there will be some electrons in the conduction band yes sir so there's an electric field applied somewhere those electrons will flow yes so that is leakage even if the device is off there would be something in the conduction band okay anna so but i mean uh i'm not able to clearly visualize the path exactly what the though the band theory tells us me that they will be leakage because every any time point of time they would be conducting electrons but that part i'm i'm just just flexing about the path yeah subthreshold means source to drain path okay but that path is provided by the depletion connections and um no not exactly so depletion definitely depletion depletion region is a so what is the difference between a depletion region and a regular substrate so i mean depletion means that what the nature of the substrate was you have avoid the excess carriers from that region basically so in depletion region all the excess carriers have been depleted yes sir so if you if you inject some electrons from one side because there are no other carriers and there is an electric field across the depletion region these electrons will move very quickly across the depletion region that is one aspect but uh there may not be a complete depletion region also formed there okay okay okay so probably when we go into an accumulation mode then we can say that there is a different kind of a current flowing but uh so because like i am able to visualize depletion region as a like very very high resistance kind of region i mean it's a pistons are too much unlike creator so that may be the limiting factor i i can't comment okay okay yes yeah in the first formula can you repeat the terms in the exponential because i mean it's a little blurry uh the terms in the exponential are v g s minus v t naught minus eta vds minus a gamma uh vsb so you have all these things in the book available don't worry about it i'm not going to ask you these formulae in the exams or any and no one not you will not be asking someone even in the in the interview don't worry about that and so what's the difference between vt and vt not okay so v capital t v capital t is the kt by cube component oh okay right so pd knowledge is a sub threshold voltage vt naught is the threshold voltage at 0 vds okay so [Music] [Applause] again there is some issue so we are saying that there is a sub threshold current that is flowing and that sub threshold current is dependent on vp threshold voltage that is also if the threshold voltage is lower the sub threshold current will be higher we say we are also saying that this sub threshold current is also dependent on uh the the relationship between uh source and body uh the the body bias voltage that has been applied we're also saying that the sub threshold voltage this sub threshold current is also dependent on temperature by the virtue of this component 80 by q um as temperature increases kt by q also increases so we're also saying that this subthreshold current is dependent on temperature so uh when we say that the vt of the device has changed what has happened is that uh if if you for example you change vt from 0.4 to 0.1 the the same curve when it is shifted to the left would intersect the vt the vdd or the gate input vn equal to zero axis at a different place and therefore you can have multiple decades of difference between a high weighted the leakage of a highway device and the off current of a low vt device so this is just an exemplification that you you reduced in in 65 nanometers as you reduce vt by a hundred millivolts you increase the off current by a decade because we assume that the substantial slope is 100 intervals per decade okay now we come to some other effects which are slightly nuanced but are important so one effect is drain induced barrier lowering what does this mean this means that when i apply v when i change so see typically the leakage phenomena is dependent on gate pickup voltage what is the voltage at gate and when it is off even then some current is flowing from source to drain some electron flow is happening from source to drain so that is your typical leakage definition however what happens uh there is a voltage on drain and source also that is applied and we see that there is a dependence of on current and off current on current obviously but also off current on a leakage at we did equal to zero this happens because as you increase the drain voltage the electric field contours change in such a way that uh you know okay in a long channel device what i are why is this happening today just give me a moment so first tell me you understand the difference between a long channel device and a short channel device no yes sir so what is the difference so we uh i mean the uh we reach voltage i mean the velocity saturation more quickly quickly for channel devices so you have a lower current i mean in saturation so okay so as the technology scaling happens as you use shorter length what starts to happen is that your device behaves differently than the standard you know set of equations uh that we studied till now okay this deviation and behavior is referred to as short channel effects okay and uh why do these effects happen we will look at it in in and this explanation that i am just about to start with you so let us say this is a big long channel device and over here i have a short channel device okay now in a long channel device let us say vd is uh one or two volts and vs zero so what happens uh there is this barrier between drain and source so there is a depletion width over here there is a depletion width over here and in between there is a barrier if i try to draw that barrier that barrier would look like this so what is happening this two volts that i had over here is dropping across the channel so as i move from drain side to source side this barrier is increasing if i have a higher voltage over here current should be electrons will be attracted over here now in a long channel device this barrier so electrons have to jump from source into this region so this barrier remains high however in a short channel device what happens is that as drain tends to come closer we see that the barrier reduces when this barrier reduces what happens more electrons can now flow so for a short channel device let us look at it in a separate graph for a short center device the drain and source are closer and the barrier over here reduces than this value so electrons can now more easily jump and reach the drain this is called as drain induced barrier lowering this happens because over here we saw that depletion regions were far apart whereas in short channel devices depletion regions actually start to come very close to each other as they start to come close to each other the barrier starts to reduce questions so what is this is this some energy barrier or some physical barrier today yeah this is the energy this is the conduction band that i have shown uh so here we assume that the depletion of drain and the swords in long channel have reached their maximum depth even if how much ever the video is raised in long channel so the source and drain this junction this is the junction property this is not again talking about the gate over here i am talking about yeah i am talking about this the junction junction only for moga there will be some depletion wait form and uh uh then we have this voltage applied due to which this solution would have changed already yes we're talking about a static condition okay okay so we are not in okay i thought that if we increase vd maybe we can uh uh we can achieve the ibl in long term also uh no no never okay sir yes sir so this condition which you are we were we are speaking right now is in the uh is during my transistor is off right yes so sir if my transistor is off then obviously my depletion region would be above because there is no inversion inversion layer over there i didn't understand why this depletion region moved a bit up diffusion region there is no depletion region also here rashford depletion region there no but okay sorry yes sir i know [Music] we are getting from sir exactly is it due to drain and source yeah that is the pn junction okay okay let's go thank you okay this is the energy conduction band diagram but how is this a financial magnet which looks like some physical structure um so let me if i if i simply move this just a minute swat on it now and so are you able to see this now let me also put this here hello yeah are you able to see this that is what i am saying that's it because it's 2 volts over here the overall energy is lower over here and because uh it's high over there this this in fact the source source would be the since sources are zero this energy would be appearing higher but there is this barrier and we this vd over here the change in depletion width that is called that it causes does not impact anything on the values on the source side whereas when you apply a high vd over here it causes a change in depletion width in such a manner that the source also starts to get impacted and therefore the barrier reduces sir why did the vd become high sir because you charge the capacitor in an inverter you charge the capacitor to vdd yes sir yes right so you change the read and you change the vdna yes sir okay so so even when the like uh vgs was less than dt but still that there would be a depletion under the gate also now so but we have not considered that in this uh there would be a depletion another gate at all times there is some bgs i mean there will be some kind of yeah there will be some depletion but when so there would be a point where there will be no depletion also so we are not really talking about whether there is a depletion there or not what we are saying is that the drain voltage and the impact of drain voltage on the depletion layer starts to impact the starts to impact the barrier on the source side also so sir like it's like uh in short you're seeing that when uh in the short channel devices when we there is a change in the voltage on the vd so that changes depletion at the dairy but that also in effect changes at the source so the so it changes the barrier at the source and therefore leakage current changes and that is what is called as zone induced barrier lowering okay okay so high rain voltage causes current to increase and that is what you are seeing in this red region over here sir yes sir uh so now as uh someone already asked so we were speaking about nmos previously and my nmos will be off when my input will be zero yeah right sir so input is nothing but we are giving it to gate so i don't see any kind of depletion region forming over there because my gate voltage is zero uh but the voltage that i have applied at gate is zero but the doping that i could have done on the gate or the metal that i would have used for the gate can still pin it in such a value that there could be a depletion region yeah you can study so this is all ssd you can read that there and you will find out okay so now that was uh the ibl then there is another effect which is called as body effect where we"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,EavOMJjv87s,say that as you change the voltage of the body you will see that the VT would change and as DT changes you will also observe that leakage would change okay so when we apply any body bias there is an expected impact on leakage uh body bias or even when we do not apply body bias the very fact that my source and drain now let us talk of it in terms of the stack of an nmos of a nand gate now that this particular device look at this its body terminal is at Ground Hannah but what is the value of the source terminal if my this device is off what is the value on the source some finite value the value on the source could be could be vdd also if if my uh you know if a is on if a is uh if a is 1 and B is 0 then what happens this this starts to charge this node so this internal node could be ready also but if a is also off a is also 0 then this internal node would could be anything need not necessarily be ready but it could be some floating number are you able to see this so when a is when it can it will be vdd but otherwise we cannot Clearly say what it will be yeah some value VX would be there what that reacts will be we can again apply get off current law and voltage law on the uh uh you know on the stack of nmoses considering their off resistances everything we can find that value of VX but so we can find that out but we we clearly we say that it is not vdd it is somewhere intermediate exact value we do not know huh so what happens there is a voltage between source and body that is effectively getting applied huh and that is what we call as body effect it reads it leads to uh increasing or it increased in leads increasing in VT and therefore reduction in leakage it is also called as stack effect okay so what does this mean what does this entail for us yeah this is again Boxster could you please State what this stack effect against her I I got disconnected so sorry okay so when one of the inputs is off let us say B input is off yes the input is off and put us on we know that the the voltage at the intermediate node is vdd yes sir when a is also off that is a is also 0 then there will be some value at this particular node intermediate node yes sir yeah whatever it is one thing is clear that there is a supply or there is a vsb that this device will experience because body is definitely at zero yes and we are saying there's some voltage at the source yes sir so we will have a change in VT of the device the VT of the device would increase and what do we observe we observe a reduction in leakage this reduction in leakage is called as stack effect so how did the leakage reducer uh if DT increases what happens oh okay okay okay okay so I forgot yes thank you okay so that being said what else do we say we say that in a so what we do observe is that in a nand gate then as you change your inputs see the stack effect will happen differently when the inputs are 1 0 versus when they are zero zero are you able to see this yes sir so with that body effect happening differently over there uh we would actually observe that the leakage through a through a stack of two or three devices can actually reduce my orders of magnitude for example if all the inputs in the nmos stack are zero then the sub threshold leak it is 0.4 but when all of them are one then essentially the let us not say all of them are one let us say one one zero then the sub threshold leakage to the nmos side is 5.6 when all of them are one then the pmoses are leaking then the entirely different leakage mechanism has come into picture but until here we are looking at the effect of body body terminal only like the body effect only um overhead there's no body effect but over here there is a full body effect coming into picture both on VX and on VZ so why would there be leakage When A and B are 1 and C is zero because intermediate node will be connected to ground and so with the body yeah but leakage will happen from why to we said no yes sir so but SB is zero so VT will be yeah in that case there is no stack effect see did we take any stack effect there yes yes there is that is what we are saying that is exactly what we are saying that if so depending on which terminals are zero which ones are one we will have stack effect or not no stack effect Okay so I know that is exactly what we are saying yes so this is what you're also observing in your simulations am I right so when it when it is 1 0 0 then there is no stack effect it is showing okay Anna sir yeah yes no um yes sir how are we supposed to look into this specific term I'm like uh I substrate or I gate or I total how am I supposed to look into that leakage currency exactly in components of leakage you can you can measure the current at the gate terminal it will give you the gate leakage you can measure the current at the drain terminal it will give you the drain leakage of threshold leakage okay okay sir okay thank you this is probe and measure yes it is and do you see why deadly gate is changing so significantly when is deadly kit happening all inputs are high sir so their secret is happening in all those situations where the gate input is high and these inputs are zero so when all these are one ABC all are one then it is 0 at all the places so there is highest get leakage when all inputs are zero there is no gate leakage huh sir what is the first second column actually is what is written in the today's heading sir can you just it is blurry this is I sub this is okay so sir like we take we basically uh see the stack effect for every different node and better wherever we will see that the BSB is kind of uh greater than zero that will basically for that particular device that sub threshold will introduce yeah okay okay so this is so you will not really do it for every every gate and everything but yes to do an analysis you should be able to do it for example for a simple nor gate also How would how do you expect the leakage of a nor gate to change in different cases okay so depending on your input combination the gate leakage would change so but how do uh how do I say that how do I conclude any important reason I will give for change in grade teachers there is a voltage at gate and there is a voltage on the Source or drain due to which let us say just give me a minute so there is this so what is happening is this commitment so what we are saying that if the voltage over here is very different from the voltage over here then there will be direct leakage from gate to drain and Source let us say okay so what happens uh the voltage on the source and drain is also reflected across the channel region the body the transistor region and tunneling would happen let us say this is 1.2 volts and this is zero so the the channel region is also all at zero so 1.2 volts across a very thin gate oxide let us say 0.12 1.2 nanometers or 12 angstroms real angstrom device uh 1.2 volts across it there will there is bound to be gate leakage so tunneling happens funneling means electrons from one side of the dielectric so what is this let us say this is the date dielectric this is uh and these are your source and drain region this is gate and this is your Source slash drain region so what happens uh the the electron simply tunnel despite there being a barrier They Don't Really climb the barrier the simply tunnel by the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle yeah and uh you have some current flowing okay and that is why great leakage would change when you apply uh depending on inputs sir is it only with drain and Source or is it also with bodies tunneling also but that will rush into great those electrons that will enter into the body will rush into the source and drain region so it will be visible as source and only Pfizer so I am not able to get the stack when the stack effect is getting zero like okay so in this particular thing uh let us say oh so let us let us look at it over here what are we saying we are saying that when inputs are one zero zero let us say uh fifth row so a is one yes a is one means vs is equal to zero yes sir now what happens to v z v z can't be zero because you know there will be some stack effect yes sir okay enough now let us look at the 101 case C is one and a is one and C is transmitted to v z it becomes VD minus v t yes sir yes sir and since a is one therefore v x is equal to 0 we're not talking about stack effect anywhere okay okay because there is a deterministic voltage we know what it is yes yes sir stack effective we don't know the voltage we can find out but really we just simply saying there's a stack effects okay okay so but then why you have written the 0 over there I mean it should start effect is there right okay wizard is there okay fine I'm sorry okay I don't get your question rather yes sir so I mean uh in the case of zero one one be uh okay we are getting bdd minus DT okay right so there is a stack effect right okay yeah yes yeah so what does intermediate mean I mean what does intermediate a is reflecting this you tell me and it just analyze it yourself and tell me [Music] we are saying a0 B is 1 C 0. um so VD minus VT cannot come to either VX or v z yes but we actually some voltage which would appear at both VX and v z which is also again different from the stack effect as we are talking about it it could it could be similar but because there is some on resistance of N2 which also comes into picture now you cannot really say that stack effect um okay I mean it is not neither somebody talking about after the sensors over here now there is a non-resistance also that has come into picture okay so it is neither stack or neither will be minus fitting so it is okay okay so and these great leakage currents this 6.3 12.6 and 18.9 they are exact I mean multiples of 6.3 so does this mean that we can depending on the state I mean depending on the type of input we can determine some nodes Council notes that that's that are on or have some voltage and then we can determine the exact multiplication Factor yeah that was what we will look also in a way looking at now if the if this many gates are one and there is uh we did like uh look at case 0 1 1. hmm what is happening there in the case of zero one one my VX and v z are both are VD minus v t even for the devices where the gate is at one yeah the differential across the gate is just a VT so there is no tunneling that will happen but when the differential across the gate is full bdd that doesn't tunneling happens so as soon as you put for example v x equal to 0 you see currents are in the range of 6.3 Nano amperes okay enough as it becomes 0 for both VX and v z Uh current increased further yes and then in the last one it's the pmos leakage current that is coming into picture okay okay so I will have to reset it once again just give me a moment sir yes sir uh I don't know if this is a basic question or something but sir the nmos which is present in the center and between two pmosis and one and most first suppose we are we are considering an end game uh sir could you please uh explain why we are connecting our body to ground surface why we are connecting our body to ground directly you tell me what is the physical structure of the device physical structure yes sir to connect the body to Source somewhere let us say VX somewhere and uh to ground elsewhere what do you need can you have the same pvl in which the two devices can be made yes yes so can you make them in the same people if you have to keep different substrate voltages can the P well be same so uh or let us put it differently if the P well is same can there be different voltages on the body no there can't be sir yeah and why are you asking this question sir uh but okay okay so we just want to maintain the voltage why did we cover the layout part before this part so that you understand that something is not possible in terms of a layout hypothetically in a simulation you can put whatever value on your body but then if you have to design the layout of that and you design it the way we do then the body terminals will all be actually shorted is it not yes we do not have different bodies in which you will lay out those,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EavOMJjv87s,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EavOMJjv87s
Transcript: say that as you change the voltage of the body you will see that the VT would change and as DT changes you will also observe that leakage would change okay so when we apply any body bias there is an expected impact on leakage uh body bias or even when we do not apply body bias the very fact that my source and drain now let us talk of it in terms of the stack of an nmos of a nand gate now that this particular device look at this its body terminal is at Ground Hannah but what is the value of the source terminal if my this device is off what is the value on the source some finite value the value on the source could be could be vdd also if if my uh you know if a is on if a is uh if a is 1 and B is 0 then what happens this this starts to charge this node so this internal node could be ready also but if a is also off a is also 0 then this internal node would could be anything need not necessarily be ready but it could be some floating number are you able to see this so when a is when it can it will be vdd but otherwise we cannot Clearly say what it will be yeah some value VX would be there what that reacts will be we can again apply get off current law and voltage law on the uh uh you know on the stack of nmoses considering their off resistances everything we can find that value of VX but so we can find that out but we we clearly we say that it is not vdd it is somewhere intermediate exact value we do not know huh so what happens there is a voltage between source and body that is effectively getting applied huh and that is what we call as body effect it reads it leads to uh increasing or it increased in leads increasing in VT and therefore reduction in leakage it is also called as stack effect okay so what does this mean what does this entail for us yeah this is again Boxster could you please State what this stack effect against her I I got disconnected so sorry okay so when one of the inputs is off let us say B input is off yes the input is off and put us on we know that the the voltage at the intermediate node is vdd yes sir when a is also off that is a is also 0 then there will be some value at this particular node intermediate node yes sir yeah whatever it is one thing is clear that there is a supply or there is a vsb that this device will experience because body is definitely at zero yes and we are saying there's some voltage at the source yes sir so we will have a change in VT of the device the VT of the device would increase and what do we observe we observe a reduction in leakage this reduction in leakage is called as stack effect so how did the leakage reducer uh if DT increases what happens oh okay okay okay okay so I forgot yes thank you okay so that being said what else do we say we say that in a so what we do

is zero so VT will be yeah in that case there is no stack effect see did we take any stack effect there yes yes there is that is what we are saying that is exactly what we are saying that if so depending on which terminals are zero which ones are one we will have stack effect or not no stack effect Okay so I know that is exactly what we are saying yes so this is what you're also observing in your simulations am I right so when it when it is 1 0 0 then there is no stack effect it is showing okay Anna sir yeah yes no um yes sir how are we supposed to look into this specific term I'm like uh

gate leakage you can measure the current at the drain terminal it will give you the drain leakage of threshold leakage okay okay sir okay thank you this is probe and measure yes it is and do you see why deadly gate is changing so significantly when is deadly kit happening all inputs are high sir so their secret is happening in all those situations where the gate input is high and these inputs are zero so when all these are one ABC all are one then it is 0 at all the places so there is highest get leakage when all inputs are zero there is no gate leakage huh sir what is the first second column actually is what is written in the today's heading sir can you just it is blurry this is I sub this is okay so sir like we take we basically uh see the stack effect for every different node and better wherever we will see that the BSB is kind of uh greater than zero that will basically for that particular device that sub threshold will introduce yeah okay okay so this is so you will not really do it for every every gate and everything but yes to do an analysis you should be able to do it for example for a simple nor gate also How would how do you expect the leakage of a nor gate to change in different cases okay so depending on your input combination the gate leakage would change so but how do uh how do I say that how do I conclude any important reason I will give for change in grade teachers there is a voltage at gate and there is a voltage on the Source or drain due to which let us say just give me a minute so there is this so what is happening is this commitment so what we are saying that if the voltage over here is very different from the voltage over here then there will be direct leakage from gate to drain and Source let us say okay so what happens uh the voltage on the source and drain is also reflected across the channel region the body the transistor region and tunneling would happen let us say this is 1.2 volts and this is zero so the the channel region is also all at zero so 1.2 volts across a very thin gate oxide let us say 0.12 1.2 nanometers or 12 angstroms real angstrom device uh 1.2 volts across it there will there is bound to be gate leakage so tunneling happens funneling means electrons from one side of the dielectric so what is this let us say this is the date dielectric this is uh and these are your source and drain region this is gate and this is your Source slash drain region so what happens uh the the electron simply tunnel despite there being a barrier They Don't Really climb the barrier the simply tunnel by the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle yeah and uh you have some current flowing okay and that is why great leakage would change when you apply uh depending on inputs sir is it only with drain and Source or is it also with bodies tunneling also but that will rush into great those electrons that will enter into the body will rush into the source and drain region so it will be visible as source and only Pfizer so I am not able to get the stack when the stack effect is getting zero like okay so in this particular thing uh let us say oh so let us let us look at it over here what are we saying we are saying that when inputs are one zero zero let us say uh fifth row so a is one yes a is one means vs is equal to zero yes sir now what happens to v z v z can't be zero because you know there will be some stack effect yes sir okay enough now let us look at the 101 case C is one and a is one and C is transmitted to v z it becomes VD minus v t yes sir yes sir and since a is one therefore v x is equal to 0 we're not talking about stack effect anywhere okay okay because there is a deterministic voltage we know what it is yes yes sir stack effective we don't know the voltage we can find out but really we just simply saying there's a stack effects okay okay so but then why you have written the 0 over there I mean it should start effect is there right okay wizard is there okay fine I'm sorry okay I don't get your question rather yes sir so I mean uh in the case of zero one one be uh okay we are getting bdd minus DT okay right so there is a stack effect right okay yeah yes yeah so what does intermediate mean I mean what does intermediate a is reflecting this you tell me and it just analyze it yourself and tell me [Music] we are saying a0 B is 1 C 0. um so VD minus VT cannot come to either VX or v z yes but we actually some voltage which would appear at both VX and v z which is also again different from the stack effect as we are talking about it it could it could be similar but because there is some on resistance of N2 which also comes into picture now you cannot really say that stack effect um okay I mean it is not neither somebody talking about after the sensors over here now there is a non-resistance also that has come into picture okay so it is neither stack or neither will be minus fitting so it is okay okay so and these great leakage currents this 6.3 12.6 and 18.9 they are exact I mean multiples of 6.3 so does this mean that we can depending on the state I mean depending on the type of input we can determine some nodes Council notes that that's that are on or have some voltage and then we can determine the exact multiplication Factor yeah that was what we will look also in a way looking at now if the if this many gates are one and there is uh we did like uh look at case 0 1 1. hmm what is happening there in the case of zero one one my VX and v z are both are VD minus v t even for the devices where the gate is at one yeah the differential across the gate is just a VT so there is no tunneling that will happen but when the differential across the gate is full bdd that doesn't tunneling happens so as soon as you put for example v x equal to 0 you see currents are in the range of 6.3 Nano amperes okay enough as it becomes 0 for both VX and v z Uh current increased further yes and then in the last one it's the pmos leakage current that is coming into picture okay okay so I will have to reset it once again just give me a moment sir yes sir uh I don't know if this is a basic question or something but sir the nmos which is present in the center and between two pmosis and one and most first suppose we are we are considering an end game uh sir could you please uh explain why we are connecting our body to ground surface why we are connecting our body to ground directly you tell me what is the physical structure of the device physical structure yes sir to connect the body to Source somewhere let us say VX somewhere and uh to ground elsewhere what do you need can you have the same pvl in which the two devices can be made yes yes so can you make them in the same people if you have to keep different substrate voltages can the P well be same so uh or let us put it differently if the P well is same can there be different voltages on the body no there can't be sir yeah and why are you asking this question sir uh but okay okay so we just want to maintain the voltage why did we cover the layout part before this part so that you understand that something is not possible in terms of a layout hypothetically in a simulation you can put whatever value on your body but then if you have to design the layout of that and you design it the way we do then the body terminals will all be actually shorted is it not yes we do not have different bodies in which you will lay out those"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,52kZoHsX--A,devices okay okay sir yes sir yes so from what we have seen till now if we want to reduce leakage what do we do we increase the vto devices high vt devices we say would have lesser leakage we use stacks and we decrease vb because we saw that in a stack effect there is some reverse body reverse or you know some source bias that is happening which is leading to reduction in leakage and we do that in terms of a body biasing also we say let us apply reverse body bias in sleep mode sleep means in inactive modes and forward body bias in active modes okay so last time there was this question i think in the office hours as to what is the difference between uh clock gating or power power gaiting uh clock dating and sleep so for example we could say that sleep mode involves much more than just enable signal on the clock dating path okay so gate leakage another a slide just to give you an estimate of how the gate leakage changes so when the physical gate oxide thickness was 19 angstroms uh and we were operating at a at a vdd in the range of 1.8 volts we had a gate leakage in the order of 10 raised to power minus 4 or something ok not really significant as we came to more finer you know advanced geometries then leakage started to become important and as as it is also said that in 65 nanometers and lower technologies where the silicon dioxide gate is used the t-ox is actually less than one nanometer and gate leakage you will notice increases very significantly it becomes a very significant part of overall leakage especially at room temperature see sub threshold uh leakage we already observed is dependent on temperature huh so at room temperature gate leakage becomes a very significant component and therefore we see that in advanced technologies gate leakage is something that we are worried about in the previous slide we also saw the stacked effect the stack effect and we saw that gate leakage over there is much uh much very predominant it was it was reasonably high component of the total leakage of that particular gate depending on the input combination huh you remember you said okay so yes so you said that to decrease the like leakage we can you decrease the body uh bias basically so but like when we were seeing the stack effect when we're seeing the stack thing so so we know that each of my basically inverses in the different pivots right now it's in same people yes sir all the n masses are in the same people okay all then masses are in the same table so their bodies are ground but their source is at vx or vz okay so effectively those transistors are in reverse bias because source voltage is higher than the body terminal voltage if i make any more devices in the in the same people the substrate region that is the common piece of set region is it not they're naturally connected sorry sorry so actually i was arguing about the like uh for the end well kind of thing like i was thinking even in this if you're if you're biasing all the involves through the same value and all envelopes are then connected okay i know so yes mother so this body by so this body was some place to our advantage when we talk about leakage but wouldn't it create uh non-uniform currents and that will lead to some unexpected behavior of the device so because substrate is not directly connected to the source then this means that for if i stack my transistors then they will all have different vts at different point of times at different point of operations so wouldn't that change the current through each of those devices in the stack effect the leakage changes to the current to the devices is changing so now the current is not uniform like for e for modeling will still be followed yes yes sir it will be followed so whichever is resisted device whichever can sink the lowest current that will define the total current in the system okay okay so okay okay so don't assume there is any current accumulation anywhere casey will still be followed yes sir there is no accumulation but as you said that the current the device that can sync lowest current will now be the limiting factor now since the top stacks will uh as we stack the transistors the above transistors will become bad things so wouldn't that change my delays and all those when we will move to the combinational or combinational logic design you will see that there is a way to design around the delays due to stacks you will see that that is called tapered design okay it will impact yes for sure it will impact but there is a way to handle it we will handle it okay so yes all nmos sir i i understood that there is a common uh p p substrate that's the reason why uh we are grounding all the bodies to ground sir but uh why why is the cadence giving us an option to uh connect the body to somewhere for an nmos to be specific okay i do understand that for pmos we uh we have that but for nmoser why does the cadence even give an option why can't it directly uh ground ground around all the uh ground all the bodies of nmos because there is a there is a possibility in the technology to have a have what is called as buried and well or deep and well that deep envelope is used to separate evils yes sir and when you can separate those people by using that buried and well then what happens you can actually give it yes also separately so for rf circuits or for some specific designs designers may want to give that kind of area and therefore technology has to give you an option to connect the body terminal to different levels okay so as a designer you have all the flexibility but the device which i select is nsvt lp or psvtlp in cadence for suppose so all rf designs also the same devices will be used okay so the design methodology is different so there would be an option where i could enable a deep and well yes you will have to draw it you'll have to draw it on the um in the layout layout okay then your pls will be separated okay okay okay sir thank you okay like if you had a question so yes sir i mean why would i be needing to like separate the p wells i mean actually the whole point was that only right because by doing one deeper like now suppose you do not want the stack effect as mother was saying that the performance would change so like i as i could as i could understand that the stack effect was coming into play uh because of our design only because we had designing the nand gates such that like three there will be the cause of so what happened because of that vx became higher than substrate voltage yes that is why a reason that is the reason why your leakage is reduced is it not now you do not want vt to change what will you do you will need to connect the substrate also to vx yes so then you will need deep and so i can do that in d in every p l we can connect to ground and it's it's a huge area of penalty huge okay yeah so you do not do it for digital circuits okay this is if done it is only done for analog rf circuits not for digital circuits at all it's a huge area penalty okay so but cadence would always give you option to have that body terminal and you may also want at some time to connect the body terminals as a designer you should have all the flexibility okay so so like for example in the digital circuit i would by default be observing the track effect i would get by the virtue of my design only because i'm designed like they would be tmosset animosity one so so like then why basically uh do i have to basic uh then buy should it buy should i basically select the low bt devices because because you want speed yes yes sir i mean because because static effect because which is stack effect i am getting the kind of the reduction in leakage so why should i go because only the side you're saying that 95 are basically high weight devices but for the digital circuit i can go for the low beating yeah so it means that you will have to use in more transistors if you do not go to high vt you only use stacking to reduce leakage then uh you will not be able so for for even an inverter you will do stack off two n mosses and stack off to the muscles to reduce leakage yeah your waist area okay instead you you do it like hpt devices okay actually i'm considering only the static cmos implementation yeah okay so let's quickly look at junction leakage junction leakage has three components basic you know ordinary diode leakage because there are diodes everywhere then band to band tunneling what happens in banter and tunneling so this is the diode leakage thing where since there is a source and drain region and there is a depletion region there there is some diode current that will flow reverse reverse biased pn junctions will have some leakage then we're talking about band to band tunneling what is this let us say that i apply so you know we're talking about halo doping and all those things over here let us say that i have applied a reverse body bias on my body so that i reduce leakage what happens the conduction band of one side starts to become aligned with the valence band of the other sides okay and if uh the the depletion width is small enough then electrons will simply tunnel from the valence band on one side to the conduction band on the other that is called band-to-band tunneling sir why are these getting aligned sir align means so initially they were like this you applied reverse body bias initially they were like this then you applied reverse body wires and they went low so now electrons will directly move from here to here sorry from here to here because you applied a reverse body bias that is where it can happen you expected that by applying reverse body bias i will remove the sub threshold leakage which you will you will definitely reduce sub threshold leakage but you will introduce band to band tunneling okay focus yeah then there is also something called as gate induced rain leakage what does this mean this means that due to some so let us say there is this device huh let us say there is this device on the drain side let us go to whiteboard so what happens is there is slight overlap between source drain and gate regions so when you apply some voltage on the gate when you apply some voltage on the gate there is some change in potential the the depletion region over here in this region such that there is higher leakage in the drain why why are we only talking about the rain because rain is at a higher voltage source and body are typically connected shorted but drain and body are at different potentials so because of the electrostatic contours changing shape near the drain region when you apply gate voltage you see that the drain leakage increases and that is reflected by this curve there that is reflected by this red red shaded region in the curve there okay this is called as gate induced drain leakage so we've looked at different kinds of leakages till now now if i now if i say that i want to uh how do i put it if i say that i want to now reduce overall leakage in the system what all levers do you think we have hello just start effect huh can you start basically stacking okay you can stack the body of it due to which the body effect will come okay what else so i mean we can connect the body to different voltages if it is possible we can connect the body to different voltages if possible for the p pmosses it may be possible by again losing a lot of area and mosses you will need to lose a lot lot more area to be able to do that but let us say we we still are able to create some voltage islands where we say that substrate voltages for inactive islands you would want to keep at a different level so that leakage reduces so that is body biasing across uh clustered body biasing across different uh circuit regions huh yes okay what else can you do maybe may be thicker oxides thicker oxides okay but super oxides you will see that it will lead to change in speed the speed would be great so long channel devices and high cadillacs yes long channel devices high k dielectrics yes so that gate leakage reduces but a very important technique that you use is what is called as power gating so when your entire circuit when your entire circuit you know that is not going to be operated you put a set of these sleep transistors or header switch transistors on vdd so your power gated block does not directly get vdd it gets a new supply which is virtual vdd or vddv okay when you know that this particular block is is going to be off or not operational you can simply switch off these pmoses you can take sleep to one and when you take sleep to one what happens the supply the vdd supply is cut off okay what it does necessarily require it that at the output again you put a gating with sleep bar so that outputs do not lead to very high currents in the subsequent stages because the output as you cut off the vdd what happens the outputs of this block will start to vary between 0 and vdd will no longer be at 0 or vdd they will be anywhere which can lead to high short circuit currents in the subsequent stages to prevent that what do you do you put these and gates how do you isolate the outputs okay now it appears that this would reduce leakage yes it will reduce leakage but you should activate sleep modes only when you are doing it for a sufficient amount of time because toggling the sleep pin will in itself is at the heat it's a huge capacitance the sleep would be running all over the place it is a huge capacitance and toggling the sleep pin in itself will consume some current so that should not exceed the current that you are saving okay so what is this output what output i am taking here out from here i mean this would be the power gated block would be my pdn or the pdf pull up or to pull down it so let us say the power gated block only had the nand gate okay okay completely so like we're saying in terms of the complete gate not like the pull down on the pull up i'm talking about a power gated block which means i am talking about the full processor okay okay i'm talking about a full memory there for example okay okay okay so that is where we did not say a circuit we set a block yeah yes uh details okay yeah if there was a question so even after i found it i will still some previous stage will still be providing some inputs right here let the inputs come so i am not using the outputs of this block i anyway i'm not using the outputs of this block so let the inputs come if my vdd is not connected it will not lead to any power consumption is it still gate leakage will still be there because yeah you cannot control this so full memory inputs are just going to 20 gates if we are putting a condition on immediately then even we are removing our stack effect right sir we are adding a stack effect this vdd v is something like v x is it not yes sir we are adding a stack effect we will need to size our circuits slightly differently so that this or we'll have to have a huge capacitance on vddv so that after power up when you want to actually operate the circuit stack effect doesn't appear in the delays [Music] okay okay so that this vddv is almost equal to vdd in active mods okay so okay so what we looked at today was three kinds of leakages static power being governed by sub threshold leakage gate leakage and junction leakage we looked at uh scaling effects like uh dibl gidl and we talked about high k dielectrics also that we use high k dielectrics so that physical gate oxide thickness can be higher and gate leakage can be reduced and to reduce leakage we discussed about using high vt lowering vdd we already discussed in the last class also body effect large lengths you mentioned and then we also talked about sleep transistors towards the end okay so yes so i have a doubt in the previous slide okay yeah so uh we we are adding this p moses to uh cut off the connection between vdd and the power we are our logic right yeah now when these female p masses are turned off so there would be some sub threshold leakage also in those pmoses so yeah and that will come but overall leakage will reduce now for our logic the leakage will reduce but that uh threshold leakage of those p masses so it is again the same thing look at it like this there will be a kcl that will apply yes sir so if the power gated block does not does not allow syncing more current how will more current go okay okay okay equilibrium limit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52kZoHsX--A,"Link:

Transcript: devices okay okay sir yes sir yes so from what we have seen till now if we want to reduce leakage what do we do we increase the vto devices high vt devices we say would have lesser leakage we use stacks and we decrease vb because we saw that in a stack effect there is some reverse body reverse or you know some source bias that is happening which is leading to reduction in leakage and we

so yes all nmos sir i i understood that there is a common uh p p substrate that's the reason why uh we are grounding all the bodies to ground sir but uh why why is the cadence giving us an option to uh connect the body to somewhere for an nmos to be specific okay i do understand that for pmos we uh we have that but for nmoser why does the cadence even give an option why can't it directly uh

some specific designs designers may want to give that kind of area and therefore technology has to give you an option to connect the body terminal to different levels okay so as a designer you have all the flexibility but the device which i select is nsvt lp or psvtlp in cadence for suppose so all rf designs also the same devices will be used okay so the design methodology is different so there would be an option where i could enable a deep and well yes you will have to draw it you'll have to draw it on the um in the layout layout okay then your pls will be separated okay okay okay sir thank you okay like if you had a question so yes sir i mean why would i be needing to like separate the p wells i mean actually the whole point was that only right because by doing one deeper like now suppose you do not want the stack effect as mother was saying that the performance would change so like i as i could as i could understand that the stack effect was coming into play uh because of our design only because we had designing the nand gates such that like three there will be the cause of so what happened because of that vx became higher than substrate voltage yes that is why a reason that is the reason why your leakage is reduced is it not now you do not want vt to change what will you do you will need to connect the substrate also to vx yes so then you will need deep and so i can do that in d in every p l we can connect to ground and it's it's a huge area of penalty huge okay yeah so you do not do it for digital circuits okay this is if done it is only done for analog rf circuits not for digital circuits at all it's a huge area penalty okay so but cadence would always give you option to have that body terminal and you may also want at some time to connect the body terminals as a designer you should have all the flexibility okay so so like for example in the digital circuit i would by default be observing the track effect i would get by the virtue of my design only because i'm designed like they would be tmosset animosity one so so like then why basically uh do i have to basic uh then buy should it buy should i basically select the low bt devices because because you want speed yes yes sir i mean because because static effect because which is stack effect i am getting the kind of the reduction in leakage so why should i go because only the side you're

you applied reverse body bias initially they were like this then you applied reverse body wires and they went low so now electrons will directly move from here to here sorry from here to here because you applied a reverse body bias that is where it can happen you expected that by applying reverse body bias i will remove the sub threshold leakage which you will you will definitely reduce sub threshold leakage but you will introduce band to band tunneling okay focus yeah then there is also something called as gate induced rain leakage what does this mean this means that due to some so let us say there is this device huh let us say there is this device on the drain side let us go to whiteboard so what happens is there is slight overlap between source drain and gate regions so when you

electrostatic contours changing shape near the drain region when you apply gate voltage you see that the drain leakage increases and that is reflected by this curve there that is reflected by this red red shaded region in the curve there okay this is called as gate induced drain leakage so we've looked at different kinds of leakages till now now if i now if i say that i want to uh how do i put it if i say that i want to now reduce overall leakage in the system what all levers do you think we have hello just start effect huh can you start basically stacking okay you can stack the body of it due to which the body effect will come okay what else so i mean we can connect the body to different voltages if it is possible we can connect the body to different voltages if possible for the p pmosses it may be possible by again losing a lot of area and mosses you will need to lose a lot lot more area to be able to do that but let us say we we still are able to create some voltage islands where we say that substrate voltages for inactive islands you would want to keep at a different level so that leakage reduces so that is body biasing across uh clustered body biasing across different uh circuit regions huh yes okay what else can you do maybe may be thicker oxides thicker oxides okay but super oxides you will see that it will lead to change in speed the speed would be great so long channel devices and high cadillacs yes long channel devices high k dielectrics yes so that gate leakage reduces but a very important technique that you use is what is called as power gating so when your entire circuit when your entire circuit you know that is not going to be operated you put a set of these sleep transistors or header switch transistors on vdd so your power gated block does not

should not exceed the current that you are saving okay so what is this output what output i am taking here out from here i mean this would be the power gated block would be my pdn or the pdf pull up or to pull down it so let us say the power gated block only had the nand gate okay okay completely so like we're saying in terms of the complete gate not like the pull down on the pull up i'm talking about a power gated block which means i am talking about the full processor okay okay i'm talking about a full memory there for example okay okay okay so that is where we did not say a circuit we set a block yeah yes uh details okay yeah if there was a question so even after i found it i will still some previous stage will still be providing some inputs right here let the inputs come so i am not using the outputs of this block i anyway i'm not using the outputs of this block so let the inputs come if my vdd is not connected it will not lead to any power consumption is it still gate leakage will still be there because yeah you cannot control this so full memory inputs are just going to 20 gates if we are putting a condition on immediately then even we are removing our stack effect right sir we are adding a stack effect this vdd v is something like v x is it not yes sir we are adding a stack effect we will need to size our circuits slightly differently so that this or we'll have to have a huge capacitance on vddv so that after power up when you want to actually operate the circuit stack effect doesn't appear in the delays [Music] okay okay so that this vddv is almost equal to vdd in active mods okay so okay so what we looked at today was three kinds of leakages static power being governed by sub threshold leakage gate leakage and junction leakage we looked at uh scaling effects like uh dibl gidl and we talked about high k dielectrics also that we use high k dielectrics so that physical gate oxide thickness can be higher and gate leakage can be reduced and to reduce leakage we discussed about using high vt lowering vdd we already discussed in the last class also body effect large lengths you mentioned and then we also talked about sleep transistors towards the end okay so yes so i have a doubt in the previous slide okay yeah so uh we we are adding this p moses to uh cut off the connection between vdd and the power we are our logic right yeah now when these female p masses are turned off so there would be some sub threshold leakage also in those pmoses so yeah and that will come but overall leakage will reduce now for our logic the leakage will reduce but that uh threshold leakage of those p masses so it is again the same thing look at it like this there will be a kcl that will apply yes sir so if the power gated block does not does not allow syncing more current how will more current go okay okay okay equilibrium limit"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,whDILV2AOyQ,to our next section which is where your project also is we're talking about combinational logic design so in this combination of circuit design let us first understand what is the difference between combinational circuit and sequential circuit who will tell me sir output of combinational circuit only depends on the present inputs and the output of a sequential circuit depends upon present input as well as the previous input zones okay which which what is an example of a sequential circuit any fsm uh that we design sequence detector maybe no let us say circuits that you know of already you know you use them already flip flop latch and flip flop flip flops they're all sequential circuits and combinational circuit any basic comparator normal gate and gate better universal all these gates they are all combinational circuits so we'll first look at combinational logic design in this class and the next one then we will move to sequential circuit design in the in the class after that okay so in terms of combination but in the combination of circuit design then you have two different design styles most common two different design styles we'll look at other design styles also but most common styles are static cmos and dynamic so static cmos all of us know yes what is dynamic logic said in this logic we use a clock and we do not we do not use a pmos uh circuit here we use only nmos and use the pmos and nmos for giving a clock uh above and below the end logic after we can do it in two ways we can have a pull-up network or we can have a pull-down network we'll be changing our output position however regarding that uh and the main issue with this dynamic logic is that okay advantage is that area gets reduced at first and issue is that we'll have some rays around conditions and uh cascading conditions okay so we'll anyways look into much more detail in dynamic logic later but whenever we call dynamic logic whether it is even you know memory cell for example if it's a static memory then you have a 60 transistor memory cell if it's a dynamic memory then you have dynamic ram then you have a capacitor on which you will store charge so in dynamic logic there will be some some time some input combinational state where the output is not driven by anything else but is dependent on some charge stored on some capacitance so i mean the output logic will depend upon the char stone and capacitor at some point yeah output will be output will be driven because of some charge stored on some capacitor now if by some reason either because of leakage or because of crosstalk or because of some other reason that charge gets dissipated there is no way to recover that charge during the cycle and you lose data you lose you get incorrect output but during the static also the voltage the ca output is observing that only will transfer the logic to the other stage in a static cmos let us say a nand gate if there is some noise on one of the inputs will the output change okay it may have a glitch output may have a glitch but it will again come back to the original correct state is it not let us say i gave a small glitch on the input a of a nand gate there would be small glitch on the output but it will only be a glitch for a dynamic logic gate it will not get a glitch you give a glitch on the input and you will have a permanent voltage loss at the output don't worry we will see we will see this in much more detail and probably the next class but for now just remember just remember that and static cmos we are not depending we are not leaving anything to chance we actually always have a pull-up network or a pull-down network that is on so the output is always driven and dynamic logic the output may not always be driven and there will be times when the output is driven is is only because of some charge stored on some capacitor is this okay so so the charge so the capacitance drives the output or the capacitance just defines what the output state is yeah it could be it could be anything so you may have a series of inverters after this capacitance so we say okay the capacitance only drives the output but this capacitance could be the output directly so like there could be an amplifier that uh that define that actually drives some other output based on the capacity in the value stored on charge stored on capacitance yeah so is it something like that or it can directly drive let's say an inverter without any amplifier in between yeah it can directly have an inverter your dynamic gate could be could be input it could be an input to an inverter yes okay so in that case as soon as inverter reads there is a chance that this dynamic logic will discharge uh where in a cmos gate does the gate consume any power leak itself leakage will take years lots of time gate leakage is relatively much lesser than any other form of leakage [Music] so good good that you're thinking on those lines but yes i understand that you do not have the the the order of magnitude of these different components yet readily available to you so you can assume this i'm fine so don't feel bad key i gave you a different answer it's fine but that really is not that big of a botheration mother gate leakage is not really that big a moderate botheration so dynamic logic is still very widely used okay sir so i can drive a static logic by our dynamic output as well yes okay you can write static logic with a dynamic input but dynamic and dynamic logic itself has some weaknesses we will look at that in the next session it has some weaknesses and then you will need to take care of them so how many of you are actually designing a dynamic aoi or oi in your in your project put a plus one in the chat window if you are oh okay someone yeah so you will see that you will have to take care of this capacitance and you will have to check the noise immunity of your gate we will look at various various failure modes of dynamic logics you will need to just analyze your circuit accordingly okay sir i was asking that uh if even if the dram cell is not an object it is still called dynamic one it's called dynamic ram cell yes not logic dynamic dynamic because it's storing something on a capacitor and you need to refresh it you need to ensure that some leakage or whatever has happened it is kind of recovered on a regular basis yes ok so this much you know that in a static cmos there is a pull-up network and a pull-down network and that pull-up network and pull-down network are duals of each other all of you even in your assignment or somewhere else you must have seen this you already checked this in the in your exam also am i right so pull up network and pull down network are duals of each other what does this mean when one is on method okay when the pull-up network is driving then the pull-down network will be off and vice versa yes sir but how how do you make a dual sir the series transistor in n was parallel uh in in the pmos that is dual so uh the dual of a series transistor would be uh parallel transistors on the pmos side and vice versa for example in a nand gate you have n moses in series and you get a and b on the pmo side you have a parallel b and a two input nand gate you remember how is the two input nand gate made bit so in a two input nand gate you have pmos is in parallel and nmos is in series what has happened here something is happening so when when this uh so this is called a dual where the same logic is implemented as it is implemented in series in the inverses it is implemented as parallel in the pmoses and vice versa something which is implemented as uh parallel in the moses will be implemented as series in the p masses this part is clear friends yes sir okay so if i use if i connect uh n masses in the pull-up network then what happens vt drop happens and output cannot go up a vdd minus vt yes vg-dops happens and output cannot go above vdd minus vt similarly if i put a pmos on the pull down network what happens it cannot drive a proper zero it cannot drive a proper zero it will drive it only down to bt vt so this vt drop is something that you should always be alert about especially when you're driving even you are designing ptl logic so pto voters ptl we will see but when you're designing pass transistor logic uh ptl logic these uh voltage drops is something that you need to be extremely careful about okay we will look into it in detail later okay so bt drop means that we should not put the nmos in the vdn pull up network the nmos will have will have to be put in the pull-down network when the n-mast is in the pull-down network your output will go to zero otherwise the output will only go to vtp it will not be able to go down to full zero but but then why would you call it dt drop the threshold i mean because that is what happened now zero was expected to be transferred here but zero could not be transferred it got limited by the vt of this pmos okay is that okay so i need to do something with the ppt it kind of gets hanged every now and then i am not able to move there so this is one thing that we need to be alert about that there will be vt drops across the enos and pmos when they are used to transmit vdd and ground respectively okay because the p mass cannot transmit a a good ground a good zero and n mass cannot transmit a good one okay so just give me a moment if it is again opening up so when we talk of complementary cmos oh you're not able to see the slide yet am i right is my slide visible now it's visible okay so we say that pull up network is a dual of the pull-down network in a complementary cmos type and cmos is always an inverting gate if you want to implement an and gate you will have to first implement implement a nand gate and only then you will be able to implement the and gate okay so you will have you can implement inverted gates in one gate in one stage but non-inverting gates require two stages okay so this much we know i will quickly move forward any doubt in this one how to make an and gate we've already done so much of it nor gate we know nor get all of us know yes sir so if i talk of a complex cmos gate like this how would my dual the pmos network look like quickly this also i know you know sir b and c in series sir it's in parallel with a and the whole structure is parallel with anyone else has a different view or is vaishnav correct is it clear so the dual the pima site would mean that since d is parallel over here d goes in series a which was in series earlier comes in parallel and b and c which were in parallel in the nmos stack come in series okay so this would be the complex cmos gate this is like the aoys and ois that you are going to design so how to construct a complex gate first design the pull down network and then after by looking at the pull-down network you design the pull-up network okay and uh logical effort of complex gates uh are you able to see we've already done this we've already seen this slide earlier also you remember we have seen this slide and we're looking at uh the first time when we looked at the g and the h thing huh yes hello yeah so the logical effort of these gates can also be calculated in exactly the same manner as we did for the first complex gate so who will give me the value of gc or gd now 6 by 3 6 by 3 again what about p 12 by 3 12 by 3 12 by 3 great uh what about now ga over here five but what about gb eight by three what are you doing the sizing has been done yeah okay so we've ensured that the equivalent resistance of the inverter is same come whatever be the case okay so how do you estimate the delay of a complex gate like if i make a complex gate versus i make a two uh other thing what do you expect in terms of delay yeah so for this the overall h let us say is 10 b is 1 there are no branching happening anywhere and number of states is 2 in both the cases so what would be the different delays can you find out by using a logical effort analysis so this is possible only if we give our output of c load right the load has been told now 160 units okay okay okay sorry yes so we see okay p is two plus two g we know nand gates four by three four by three uh nor gate on the other side and then gbh is something like this and i get the delay to be 12.4 tau i am going quickly because this is already done what about this one in this case there is a four input first gate and one input second gate so four plus one five what about g you can quickly make this gate and find out find out its g you will see that g is equal to 2 f is gbh so 20 because h is h is 10 over here and what about total delay now total delay has increased a little appears to increase a little 14 top then why are we talking about complex gates if the delay has increased a little why are we talking about complex gates so the area reduces very significantly area reduces very significantly huh and how do we see that in the first case you say that eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight and 25 25 25 25 you just do this analysis and what about the second one see the area is reduced to 36 ah no no no sorry area is not reduced to 36 the second stage is 36 the first stage is uh 40 plus 24 that is input capacitance right yeah input capacitance you're saying is also a measure of area now no okay sorry yes is it not yes sir yeah so in the first first case what is the area eight and eight devices of eight microns each to sixty four plus four of twenty five eight so one sixty four in the second case what is the area 16 into 4 plus 36 64 36 100 so area has reduced so significantly 164 versus 100 so even if delay increase by that little amount in reality because my area is so much lesser the parasitics and everything will be lesser so in fact delay of a complex gate is also lesser okay so this is one thing in reality so this is one thing you have to prove in your projects you know this man should have a question yes sir if we if i have a gate at the complex gate which has a different g value for different uh different inputs so which which one will i take the worst g or the best g for the calculation of delay oh yeah so for calculation of propagation delay you will take the first g okay then contain elimination the best g yes ana now this is anyways calculations yes sir in project you are saying that okay we are supposed to compare this both so are we supposed to make the layout of both or only one is enough sir so how will you prove to me that area is okay yeah you can still say numbers are higher but how will you prove to me that delay is lesser delay is also lesser in the complex gate if you don't make the layout that i can say that only parasitic is small so i'll click that and peel out between how will you prove to me how will you prove to me i am also saying now okay yes yes sir one small thing so for making the layouts of non-complex gates so if you are cascading one nand gate after the other so i think metal layers would get blocked right again so atmos you may need one method to to make those connections use then only for that purpose use metal tool okay yes only for that purpose so you should be evident in that like when you show the layout it should be evident there yes okay so do you think this input order matters yes it matters so where will the propagation delay be highest which input to output delay will be highest a2 a2 or b2y if b arrives later if b has an input so see your nand gate is being driven by some other logic somewhere so if b arrives later then should b be connected to the lower and most or the upper end mass uppercut then you should connect b to the upper end mass so that what happens we can buy the output yes okay so input order we understand matters then uh okay this we already discussed yes please so why was the delay for b2 by the highest i mean wouldn't it depend on is it falling delay or raising daily yeah we were looking at the nmr stack rising for i mean when the output is rising now or when the output is falling we will have for different delays for a and b for different stimuli we will get the worst case stage even then let us look at it like this even if it is a rising delay it was zero earlier you took a to zero so now what is the capacitance that needs to be charged only the capacitance on y input by output am i right now so what's the stimuli that you're given it was output was zero initially so both a and b were one yes now i took a to 0 so that y charges to 1 that is what you want to see now price delay yes so now what is the delay what is the rc emas 2 and output is in this case b will give b will give the worst case in that case okay so let us say the output is to fall yes sir then what is the worst case this means that if a was only already one or if b was already one the other input now goes to one yes sir which one has more delay so if a changes then if a was already one then what has happened so now also vdd x is also charged to vdd or we really minus vt in fact yes okay so in both cases b is the most case yeah okay is that clear yes sir uh sir uh just to add up on this the input order also matters because uh if i consider a function a y is equal to a to b plus c then we'll have if we attach the parallel connection of v and c to the output then we'll have more capacitive capacitive loading with output so that has to be connected to the ground whereas a should be connected to the output right so method uh runs it what i'm saying is that even in a two input gate so input simple to input nand gate even there the input which is closer to the output should be the one that is arriving late yes yes sir in a simple circuit like a nand gate i'm telling you this that order demand order matters yes sir in a complex circuit you're absolutely right bang on output definitely matters yes sir okay all of us understand why it matters any questions around that please yes sign me what exactly was uh being discussed i was not able to get ranjit was if it's a complex gate it matters still more because then that will change the intermediate like suppose if it's a and b parallel and c in series in the nmo stack so if i put c above on y if y is directly connected like the first the series in transistor c is connected to the output and a r b are in parallel connected to ground then there would be one delay and if i have a different structure where a and b are in parallel connected to y and c is in series connected to ground that will have a different delay for different like there will be different delays for a b and c to output in these two structures and you have to design appropriately experiment you will see so and you are saying that the closest the input closer to the output should arrive the latest right for a nand gate yes whichever input has shortest delay should be designed to be arriving last in your path in this particular example if you have if you know that there are two inputs a and b if you know that the first input is arriving faster that first input should be connected to b but in that case if you are considering the propagation thing so the capacitance between these two uh that will discharge if it arrives fast and yeah i'm gonna get the propagate will not get the verse delay then basically yeah yeah we're not characterizing now now we are designing a path you want the delays to reduce in a past month okay okay fine okay we've moved we have graduated from characterization to designing okay so now we are ordering the input such that we get the least delays least delay in my path just like for logical effort the intent was to get least delay unless the least area in the path okay so but then in that case we will also be ha the specification will also specify okay how the signals are arriving right yeah yeah so for example if i ask you to make an adder you will know how the signals will arrive first which will arrive late yes okay you are a designer it is not about designing one gate knight is then designing a path similarly you can actually make gates asymmetric so that the non critical input may have higher load for example in this case reset bar has higher load and a critical input a has lower load so overall load of this gate would increase but the delay for signal a would reduce significantly are you able to see this see my a signal was arriving late a signal is on a critical path reset is something which like sleep in or something which already is there static signal already there so you let the reset bar come and then for a because that is the actual critical path the critical input you reduce the delay very significantly by reducing the size of the cent mass are you able to see this so if you're making full custom paths then you may want to design asymmetric gates also so that you reduce total delays are you with me any questions and this critical thing wasn't clear like the path of critical path for over here would mean path which has the largest delay so a was coming from a path which had the largest delay yes so okay a was coming last so i wanted to put a closer to the output that i already did now i want to improve performance further okay what i did was i reduced the load on load on a also so that a can arrive a little faster and i increase the load on reset bar sir how did you share the load between a and reset sir share the load i reduce the load i reduced the load of a so resistance of a increased i then said okay let me increase the size of b so that i still get the same equivalent resistance as an inverter or a regular nand gate okay okay sir yes okay yes sir sir if this is fine that you reduce the load for a but sir now y node will also take more time to discharge to the by three uh nmos which could which could be a faster discharge through four and more so wait wait wait look at it like this had it not been four by three i would have designed two and moses of resistance uh off of size 2 is so my overall resistance would have been r now what is the overall resistance now 3 by 4 r plus r by four it still is r okay so you have upsized the reset also and uh fine yes otherwise it would happen too no to yes size two so the overall area you have increased but the delay you have reduced huh and you could actually also have symmetric gates designed so you had two n masses each was two microns but your both the inputs were coming randomly at same time so you said oh i want to give equals equal delay from a to y and b to y so you make a symmetric gate like this one micron of a is closer to the output one micron of b is closer to the output the other one micron is far farther from the output you able to see this any questions on this this also so we are just reducing the load over here right we've not reduced the load over here and must be was supposed to go to a nmos which was total size 2 it is still going to total size 2. i've just changed rearrange the envelopes in such a way that equal strength of an a and b n masses is closer to y and equal strength of a and b and masses is closer to ground that's all i've done okay and you can actually also make skewed gates and i'm just taking this through because this is kind of uh very simple and the last slide on cmos okay you can also make skewed gates if you want to say that i want to favor rising outputs over because you know for example in an adder carry out carry equal to one you want to bring up faster carry goes to zero you can come bring it down later also so you know that one path is faster or let us say even a comparator a 20-bit comparator so zorgates connected to one another you know that falling would anyway be fast rising is something that will take time so i want tries to be faster so you can actually skew the sizing so that when you screw the sizing what happens your transfer characteristics shift to the left or to the right i'm not able to draw this on my screen i'm surprised by so questions here what happens when i ask you are you able to see the benefit of skewed logic any questions around that sir but this brings an overhead with a noise merging being affected right yes yes yes yes so even you know when i went to asymmetric gates noise margin could have been impacted but this increases uh the effect on the noise margin with a greater direction right so because any glitch can change the output attaining itself yes yes yes but for my preferred side i get a faster output for example if there is a signal which is which is continuously recharged to one and i want to sense when it falls yeah this can get that way first of all i want to sense it and i want to have this kind of a skewed logic yes sir i know yes sir sir okay so actually i'm not able to get this concept actually can you this of skewed gates like exactly what in here early i was able to get like an earlier we were reducing the load so now let us say let us say that i am in the first gate i am interested in output going to one output falling i am not bothered about in my state machine output going to one has a very significant role to play we're talking about a state machine here where one transition is more important than the other charging basically is more important for me than this yeah let us say that y rising is more important than by falling in the first case so what happens now the total load of a has reduced are you able to see this total load of a has reduced can you see this instead of 3 that is 2 of pmos and 1 of n mass i now have 2.5 total load additionally i said that because this load has reduced a will now transition faster and therefore my output will also transition faster i've also skewed so nmos will now have lesser on current and i will be able to take y to one level much faster so two ways i am benefiting in terms of rising of y so one was that the load was getting reduced so transitions faster but what's the other benefit to you so in the in the transfer characteristic i have shifted this i have because i have made nmos smaller than the strength of n was smaller than the strength of the p mass so my switching will happen faster now earlier at a lower value of in fact at a still higher level of a i will start to have y rising because nmos will not be able to conduct as much current as the pmos will be able to sync provide do you remember the skew the skewed invertebrates yes uh you mean that uh shift that kind of shift exactly that's it that would happen yeah but that was impacting for the noise margins i mean that is also impacting the delays that is what i am telling you okay so how will that impact the noise margin because it will just shift but not change the slow now a very small disturbance on a will also cause output y to double [Music] y is more i mean so we define noise margin as 45 degree slope for that around region c so that region c is only shifting but it is not changing its slope so what was the noise margin the noise margin was 45 degree slope while a point two zero or one so again if you repeat that please it was the point where you get that 45 degree slope just let's go to the white board we were saying that we set this point and this point yes they define my noise margin points so what is the noise margin this is the noise margin so if i have shifted this curve here if i have shifted this curve here this 45 degree or a point has shifted here so the noise margin has reduced now okay got it i understood noise margin wrong okay so when you skew when you use q gates the noise margin gets degraded okay and you could have high skew lowest q but you could you could design both the sides okay so we will stop here we have covered these concepts today we talked about uh uh static cmos where pull-up network is a dual of pull-down network we talked that complex gates are denser they are low power and they have equivalent speed we blocked about the importance of input orders symmetric and asymmetric gates and also skewed gates next class will start to talk about different logic styles ratio logic pass transistor logic and other styles okay so we will close the class today it's already beyond the class time i know this i'm sorry for that but we had more discussion and there were that was an important discussion so we didn't stop that there okay thank you guys all the best stop the recording so just before even uh when we were uh when you're saying that the input ordering when we're considered when you explain the input ordering concept we were basically more focused towards we were basically in the concept of the critical part critical delays we were discussing yes but when we were discussing the secured one it was in the context of like favoring like if that yeah now you're talking about critical path not just in terms of path but also in terms of this direction we want the transition to happen they're being very very specific so like it will be over and above that yes yes okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whDILV2AOyQ,"Link:

Transcript: to our next section which is where your project also is we're talking about combinational logic design so in this combination of circuit design let us first understand what is the difference between combinational circuit and sequential circuit who will tell me sir output of combinational circuit only depends on the present inputs and the output of a sequential circuit depends upon present input as well as the previous input zones okay which which what is an example of a sequential circuit any fsm uh that we design sequence detector maybe no let us say circuits that you

power leak itself leakage will take years lots of time gate leakage is relatively much lesser than any other form of leakage [Music] so good good that you're thinking on those lines but yes i understand that you do not have the the the order of magnitude of these different components yet readily available to you so you can assume this i'm fine so don't feel bad key i gave you a different answer it's fine but that really is not that big of a botheration mother gate leakage is not really that big a moderate botheration so dynamic logic is still very widely used okay sir so i can drive a static logic by our dynamic output as well yes okay you can write static logic with a dynamic input but dynamic and dynamic logic itself has some weaknesses we will look at that in the next session it has some weaknesses and then you will need to take care of them so how many of you are actually designing a dynamic aoi or oi in your in your project put a plus one in the chat window if you are oh okay someone yeah so you will see that you will have to take care of this capacitance and you will have to check the noise immunity of your gate we will look at various various failure modes of dynamic logics you will need to just analyze your circuit accordingly okay sir i was asking that uh if even if the dram cell is not an object it is still called dynamic one it's called dynamic ram cell yes not logic dynamic dynamic because it's storing something on a capacitor and you need to refresh it you need to ensure that some leakage or whatever has happened it is kind of recovered on a regular basis yes ok so this much you know that in a static cmos there is a pull-up network and a pull-down network and that pull-up network and pull-down network are duals of each other all of you even in your assignment or somewhere else you must have seen this you already checked this in the in your exam also am i right so pull up network and pull down network are duals of each other what does this mean when one is on method okay when the pull-up network is driving then the pull-down network will be off and vice versa yes sir but how how do you make a dual sir the series transistor in n was parallel uh in in the pmos that is dual so uh the dual of a series transistor would be uh parallel transistors on the pmos side and vice versa for example in a nand gate you have n moses in series and you get a and b on the pmo side you have a parallel b and a two input nand gate you remember how is the two input nand gate made bit so in a two input nand gate you have pmos is in parallel and nmos is in series what has happened here something is happening so when when this uh so this is called a dual where the same logic is implemented as it is implemented in series in the inverses it is implemented as parallel in the pmoses and vice versa something which is implemented as uh parallel in the moses will be implemented as series in the p masses this part is clear friends yes sir okay so if i use if i connect uh n masses in the pull-up network then what happens vt drop happens and output cannot go up a vdd minus vt yes vg-dops happens and output cannot go above vdd minus vt similarly if i put a pmos on the pull down network what happens it cannot drive a proper zero it cannot drive a proper zero it will drive it only down to bt vt so this vt drop is something that you should always be alert about especially when you're driving even you are designing ptl logic so pto voters ptl we will see but when you're designing pass transistor logic uh ptl logic these uh voltage drops is something that you need to be extremely careful about okay we will look into it in detail later okay so bt drop means that we should not put the nmos in the vdn pull up network the nmos will have will have to be put in the pull-down network when the n-mast is in the pull-down network your output will go to zero otherwise the output will only go to vtp it will not be able to go down to full zero but but then why would you call it dt drop the threshold i mean because that is what happened now zero was expected to be transferred here but zero could not be transferred it got limited by the vt of this pmos okay is that okay so i need to do something with the ppt it kind of gets hanged every now and then i am not able to move there so this is one thing that we need to be alert about that there will be vt drops across the enos and pmos when they are used to transmit vdd and ground respectively okay because the p mass cannot transmit a a good ground a good zero and n mass cannot transmit a good one okay so just give me a moment if it is again opening up so when we talk of complementary cmos oh you're not able to see the slide yet am i right is my slide visible now it's visible okay so we say that pull up network is a dual of the pull-down network in a complementary cmos type and cmos is always an inverting gate if you want to implement an and gate you will have to first implement implement a nand gate and only then you will be able to implement the and gate okay so you will have you can implement inverted gates in one gate in one stage but non-inverting gates require two stages okay so this much we know i will quickly move forward any doubt in this one how to make an and gate we've already done so much of it nor gate we know nor get all of us know yes sir so if i talk of a complex cmos gate like this how would my dual the pmos network look like quickly this also i know you know sir b and c in series sir it's in parallel with a and the whole structure is parallel with anyone else has a different view or is vaishnav correct is it clear so the dual the pima site would mean that since d is parallel over here d goes in series a which was in series earlier comes in parallel and b and c which were in parallel in the nmos stack come in series okay so this would be the complex cmos gate this is like the aoys and ois that you are going to design so how to construct a complex gate first design the pull down network and then after by looking at the pull-down network you design the pull-up network okay and uh logical effort of complex gates uh are you able to see we've already done this we've already seen this slide earlier also you remember we have seen this slide and we're looking at uh the first time when we looked at the g and the h thing huh yes hello yeah so the logical effort of these gates can also be calculated in exactly the same manner as we did for the first complex gate so who will give me the value of gc or gd now 6 by 3 6 by 3 again what about p 12 by 3 12 by 3 12 by 3 great uh what about now ga over here five but what about gb eight by three what are you doing the sizing has been done yeah okay so we've ensured that the equivalent resistance of the inverter is same come whatever be the case okay so how do you estimate the delay of a complex gate like if i make a complex gate versus i make a two uh other thing what do you expect in terms of delay yeah so for this the overall h let us say is 10 b is 1 there are no branching happening anywhere and number of states is 2 in both the cases so what would be the different delays can you find out by using a logical effort analysis so this is possible only if we give our output of c load right the load has been told now 160 units okay okay okay sorry yes so we see okay p is two plus two g we know nand gates four by three four by three uh nor gate on the other side and then gbh is something like this and i get the delay to be 12.4 tau i am going quickly because this is already done what about this one in this case there is a four input first gate and one input second gate so four plus one five what about g you can quickly make this gate and find out find out its g you will see that g is equal to 2 f is gbh so 20 because h is h is 10 over here and what about total delay now total delay has increased a little appears to increase a little 14 top then why are we talking about complex gates if the delay has increased a little why are we talking about complex gates so the area reduces very significantly area reduces very significantly huh and how do we see that in the first case you say that eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight and 25 25 25 25 you just do this analysis and what about the second one see the area is reduced to 36 ah no no no sorry area is not reduced to 36 the second stage is 36 the first stage is uh 40 plus 24 that is input capacitance right yeah input capacitance you're saying is also a measure of area now no okay sorry yes is it not yes sir yeah so in the first first case what is the area eight and eight devices of eight microns each to sixty four plus four of twenty five eight so one sixty four in the second case what is the area 16 into 4 plus 36 64 36 100 so area has reduced so significantly 164 versus 100 so even if delay increase by that little amount in reality because my area is so much lesser the parasitics and everything will be lesser so in fact delay of a complex gate is also lesser okay so this is one thing in reality so this is one thing you have to prove in your projects you know this man should have a question yes sir if we if i have a gate at the complex gate which has a different g value for different uh different inputs so which which one will i take the worst g or the best g for the calculation of delay oh yeah so for calculation of propagation delay you will take the first g okay then contain elimination the best g yes ana now this is anyways calculations yes sir in project you are saying that okay we are supposed to compare this both so are we supposed to make the layout of both or only one is enough sir so how will you prove to me that area is okay yeah you can still say numbers are higher but how will you prove to me that delay is lesser delay is also lesser in the complex gate if you don't make the layout that i can say that only parasitic is small so i'll click that and peel out between how will you prove to me how will you prove to me i am also saying now okay yes yes sir one small thing so for making the layouts of non-complex gates so if you are cascading one nand gate after the other so i think metal layers would get blocked right again so atmos you may need one method to to make those connections use then only for that purpose use metal tool okay yes only for that purpose so you should be evident in that like when you show the layout it should be evident there yes okay so do you think this input order matters yes it matters so where will the propagation delay be highest which input to output delay will be highest a2 a2 or b2y if b arrives later if b has an input so see your nand gate is being driven by some other logic somewhere so if b arrives later then should b be connected to the lower and most or the upper end mass uppercut then you should connect b to the upper end mass so that what happens we can buy the output yes okay so input order we understand matters then uh okay this we already discussed yes please so why was the delay for b2 by the highest i mean wouldn't it depend on is it falling delay or raising daily yeah we were looking at the nmr stack rising for i mean when the output is rising now or when the output is falling we will have for different delays for a and b for different stimuli we will get the worst case stage even then let us look at it like this even if it is a rising delay it was zero earlier you took a to zero so now what is the capacitance that needs to be charged only the capacitance on y input by output am i right now so what's the stimuli that you're given it was output was zero initially so both a and b were one yes now i took a to 0 so that y charges to 1 that is what you want to see now price delay yes so now what is the delay what is the rc emas 2 and output is in this case b will give b will give the worst case in that case okay so let us say the output is to fall yes sir then what is the worst case this means that if a was only already one or if b was already one the other input now goes to one yes sir which one has more delay so if a changes then if a was already one then what has happened so now also vdd x is also charged to vdd or we really minus vt in fact yes okay so in both cases b is the most case yeah okay is that clear yes sir uh sir uh just to add up on this the input order also matters because uh if i consider a function a y is equal to a to b plus c then we'll have if we attach the parallel connection of v and c to the output then we'll have more capacitive capacitive loading with output so that has to be connected to the ground whereas a should be connected to the output right so method uh runs it what i'm saying is that even in a two input gate so input simple to input nand gate even there the input which is closer to the output should be the one that is arriving late yes yes sir in a simple circuit like a nand gate i'm telling you this that order demand order matters yes sir in a complex circuit you're absolutely right bang on output definitely matters yes sir okay all of us understand why it matters any questions around that please yes sign me what exactly was uh being discussed i was not able to get ranjit was if it's a complex gate it matters still more because then that will change the intermediate like suppose if it's a and b parallel and c in series in the nmo stack so if i put c above on y if y is directly connected like the first the series in transistor c is connected to the output and a r b are in parallel connected to ground then there would be one delay and if i have a different structure where a and b are in parallel connected to y and c is in series connected to ground that will have a different delay for different like there will be different delays for a b and c to output in these two structures and you have to design appropriately experiment you will see so and you are saying that the closest the input closer to the output should arrive the latest right for a nand gate yes whichever input has shortest delay should be designed to be arriving last in your path in this particular example if you have if you know that there are two inputs a and b if you know that the first input is arriving faster that first input should be connected to b but in that case if you are considering the propagation thing so the capacitance between these two uh that will discharge if it arrives fast and yeah i'm gonna get the propagate will not get the verse delay then basically yeah yeah we're not characterizing now now we are designing a path you want the delays to reduce in a past month okay okay fine okay we've moved we have graduated from characterization to designing okay so now we are ordering the input such that we get the least delays least delay in my path just like for logical effort the intent was to get least delay unless the least area in the path okay so but then in that case we will also be ha the specification will also specify okay how the signals are arriving right yeah yeah so for example if i ask you to make an adder you will know how the signals will arrive first which will arrive late yes okay you are a designer it is not about designing one gate knight is then designing a path similarly you can actually make gates asymmetric so that the non critical input may have higher load for example in this case reset bar has higher load and a critical input a has lower load so overall load of this gate would increase but the delay for signal a would reduce significantly are you able to see this see my a signal was arriving late a signal is on a critical path reset is something which like sleep in or something which already is there static signal already there so you let the reset bar come and then for a because that is the actual critical path the critical input you reduce the delay very significantly by reducing the size of the cent mass are you able to see this so if you're making full custom paths then you may want to design asymmetric gates also so that you reduce total delays are you with me any questions and this critical thing wasn't clear like the path of critical path for over here would mean path which has the largest delay so a was coming from a path which had the largest delay yes so okay a was coming last so i wanted to put a closer to the output that i already did now i want to improve performance further okay what i did was i reduced the load on load on a also so that a can arrive a little faster and i increase the load on reset bar sir how did you share the load between a and reset sir share the load i reduce the load i reduced the load of a so resistance of a increased i then said okay let me increase the size of b so that i still get the same equivalent resistance as an inverter or a regular nand gate okay okay sir yes okay yes sir sir if this is fine that you reduce the load for a but sir now y node will also take more time to discharge to the by three uh nmos which could which could be a faster discharge through four and more so wait wait wait look at it like this had it not been four by three i would have designed two and moses of resistance uh off of size 2 is so my overall resistance would have been r now what is the overall resistance now 3 by 4 r plus r by four it still is r okay so you have upsized the reset also and uh fine yes otherwise it would happen too no to yes size two so the overall area you have increased but the delay you have reduced huh and you could actually also have symmetric gates designed so you had two n masses each was two microns but your both the inputs were coming randomly at same time so you said oh i want to give equals equal delay from a to y and b to y so you make a symmetric gate like this one micron of a is closer to the output one micron of b is closer to the output the other one micron is far farther from the output you able to see this any questions on this this also so we are just reducing the load over here right we've not reduced the load over here and must be was supposed to go to a nmos which was total size 2 it is still going to total size 2. i've just changed rearrange the envelopes in such a way that equal strength of an a and b n masses is closer to y and equal strength of a and b and masses is closer to ground that's all i've done okay and you can actually also make skewed gates and i'm just taking this through because this is kind of uh very simple and the last slide on cmos okay you can also make skewed gates if you want to say that i want to favor rising outputs over because you know for example in an adder carry out carry equal to one you want to bring up faster carry goes to zero you can come bring it down later also so you know that one path is faster or let us say even a comparator a 20-bit comparator so zorgates connected to one another you know that falling would anyway be fast rising is something that will take time so i want tries to be faster so you can actually skew the sizing so that when you screw the sizing what happens your transfer characteristics shift to the left or to the right i'm not able to draw this on my screen i'm surprised by so questions here what happens when i ask you are you able to see the benefit of skewed logic any questions around that sir but this brings an overhead with a noise merging being affected right yes yes yes yes so even you know when i went to asymmetric gates noise margin could have been impacted but this increases uh the effect on the noise margin with a greater direction right so because any glitch can change the output attaining itself yes yes yes but for my preferred side i get a faster output for example if there is a signal which is which is continuously recharged to one and i want to sense when it falls yeah this can get that way first of all i want to sense it and i want to have this kind of a skewed logic yes sir i know yes sir sir okay so actually i'm not able to get this concept actually can you this of skewed gates like exactly what in here early i was able to get like an earlier we were reducing the load so now let us say let us say that i am in the first gate i am interested in output going to one output falling i am not bothered about in my state machine output going to one has a very significant role to play we're talking about a state machine here where one transition is more important than the other charging basically is more important for me than this yeah let us say that y rising is more important than by falling in the first case so what happens now the total load of a has reduced are you able to see this total load of a has reduced can you see this instead of 3 that is 2 of pmos and 1 of n mass i now have 2.5 total load additionally i said that because this load has reduced a will now transition faster and therefore my output will also transition faster i've also skewed so nmos will now have lesser on current and i will be able to take y to one level much faster so two ways i am benefiting in terms of rising of y so one was that the load was getting reduced so transitions faster but what's the other benefit to you so in the in the transfer characteristic i have shifted this i have because i have made nmos smaller than the strength of n was smaller than the strength of the p mass so my switching will happen faster now earlier at a lower value of in fact at a still higher level of a i will start to have y rising because nmos will not be able to conduct as much current as the pmos will be able to sync provide do you remember the skew the skewed invertebrates yes uh you mean that uh shift that kind of shift exactly that's it that would happen yeah but that was impacting for the noise margins i mean that is also impacting the delays that is what i am telling you okay so how will that impact the noise margin because it will just shift but not change the slow now a very small disturbance on a will also cause output y to double [Music] y is more i mean so we define noise margin as 45 degree slope for that around region c so that region c is only shifting but it is not changing its slope so what was the noise margin the noise margin was 45 degree slope while a point two zero or one so again if you repeat that please it was the point where you get that 45 degree slope just let's go to the white board we were saying that we set this point and this point yes they define my noise margin points so what is the noise margin this is the noise margin so if i have shifted this curve here if i have shifted this curve here this 45 degree or a point has shifted here so the noise margin has reduced now okay got it i understood noise margin wrong okay so when you skew when you use q gates the noise margin gets degraded okay and you could have high skew lowest q but you could you could design both the sides okay so we will stop here we have covered these concepts today we talked about uh uh static cmos where pull-up network is a dual of pull-down network we talked that complex gates are denser they are low power and they have equivalent speed we blocked about the importance of input orders symmetric and asymmetric gates and also skewed gates next class will start to talk about different logic styles ratio logic pass transistor logic and other styles okay so we will close the class today it's already beyond the class time i know this i'm sorry for that but we had more discussion and there were that was an important discussion so we didn't stop that there okay thank you guys all the best stop the recording so just before even uh when we were uh when you're saying that the input ordering when we're considered when you explain the input ordering concept we were basically more focused towards we were basically in the concept of the critical part critical delays we were discussing yes but when we were discussing the secured one it was in the context of like favoring like if that yeah now you're talking about critical path not just in terms of path but also in terms of this direction we want the transition to happen they're being very very specific so like it will be over and above that yes yes okay"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,8QtpUhabV-A,our combinational logic where we talk about what kind of combinational logic we would be interested to look at for example ratio logic so long back so see one thing is one thing one challenge is static cmos is that for n number of inputs you have two n number of devices huh and of those two hand devices also the pmos that is the half of those two end devices and devices are also larger are you able to see this in a nand gate two input nand gate how many devices do we have two input nand gate how many devices do we have what is four devices in a nor gate how many do we have to input nor gate again four so at least two n devices are there in static cmos and what about the size of nmos and pmos there and the nor gate the pmos size is four times that of the nmr size and an and gate is it is equivalent to nmr size in a two input nand gate so what do we do now we want to look for ah is there a way to reduce the total number of devices why do we want to reduce the total number of devices what's the importance of reducing number of devices area reductions yes and in vlsi area is we want to save gold so we want to reduce area come whatever may so now we will look at a few methods a few techniques to reduce area by for example in this particular slide you will see completely doing away with the pull-up network for example so what do i do instead of all those p mosses i will just put one resistive load what's the problem with one resistive load fabrication is difficult okay so when you say that instead of static cmos i will put any other load whether it is resistive load or depletion load or pmos load since that load is always on since that load is always on what happens we will observe leakage we will observe continuous static current from vdd to vss and different types of designs were proposed resistive loads so in technologies when pmosses were not available then resistive loads or depletion loads were the only options to be used once the pmoses started to become available then pmos loads were used but these pmos loads were always on now we just saw that by using these always on loads or resistances and depletion loads what is the challenge that we expect that the output will not go to pure zero it cannot because pmos is always on some current some current will come either from rl or the pmos or the diffusion load that we have put are you with me on this any questions still here hello you can put a plus one or something in the chat window if you don't want to unmute and speak now i will not move forward until i get a feedback is that one thing sir if the load is big enough then we can obtain kind of a clear zero yes so what will be the challenge then if the road is suppose this resistive load is very resistant then i will get an almost good zero but what is the challenge i said current will be low charging would be charging current will be less so when i have to take f to one that will be very slow are you able to see this the charging will be very slow then so you cannot really keep the resistance to be extremely high also and moreover if you want to keep the resistance to be very high if you have a real resistance there then that resistance will take a lot of area if you have a pmos there or a depletion load there okay area may not be that much impacted but you will have in all the three cases whether it is resistance or transistors you will have much larger rise times so one thing we already discussed that the noise margin would degrade the low voltage will not be zero low voltage will be in the ratio of a resistance of the p network upon resistance of the the resistance of the resistance of the pull down network upon resistance of the pull down network plus rl huh and the propagation delay will also in the in the case of uh rising be dependent on rl so if you make very large resistance then the rise time will be very very large so this is not really a good way to design but you see we save lots of area so we may want to design it somewhere so these are the active loads where we have in this case nmos only technology and in this case a pmos load so in our technologies we always have pmos so we may want to do it like this but we see that there are obvious challenges if for example i have a pseudo pima pseudo nmos design where they have a pmos load because it is small and everything i have a pmos load then what happens then when just one of these inputs is on the other three are off at that point of time the current that is sunk from here will be or you know the ratio of current sunk from here or the resistance of the pmos stack and the ratio of the nmos stack resistance of the nmr stack will be such that my vol will be different so you will see that uh as my more and more transistors in that uh nor gate turn on huh i will get a no this i will get a better zero so are you able to see this not exactly why v is changing here okay so let us say the pmos resistance is 10k huh and nmos resistance is uh also 10k let us say 10k angle let us say nmos resistance is 2k each of these nmoses has resistance 2k so when all four of my n masses are on what is the effective and mass resistance [Music] so what is the value of uh vol approximately okay yes approximately vdd by 19. uh we need by 21. almost even more than 5 percent of vdd taken now let us say only one of them is on then what is happening are you able to see this yes hello but why won't we for example if we know that we are using a pseudo nmos then we can design our females also to be that equivalent resistance like happiness tell me your value how much would you want the pmos resistance to be finally ideally you would want equivalent to equal resistance on pmos and nmr so that you have almost equal delays for rise and fall yes sir so manitoba i have made it 10k whereas nmoses are 2k so my rise time will be 5 times more than fall time already [Music] you propose what number would you want to use let us use that i have no problem let us find out what that number tell me so if we use 2k for the pinocchio yes let us use 2k for the pmos then what happens when all the four outputs are one okay it will not work for you okay are you able to see this yes so when we do so what this also means is that when we do ratio logic design pseudo nmr pseudo pmos the way we size the nmos and pmos how does a very significant impact on vol and all those things and that is what is shown in this slide that as you size your pmos up what happens you reduce the pmos resistance but my vol reduced my fault time increased significantly are you able to see this this is exactly the same discussion you were having just now yes so uh not very interesting very complex you know in the sense that if while we save area we save a lot of area actually all the p mosses are gone anna so in that nor gate imagine the p mosses would have if the nmos is sized one the pmos would have been sized it's a four input thing huh what would happen the size of the p moses hello four times the size four times eight times sixteen times six four fifteen sixteen four input thing yeah anna so 16 into four you have saved how much 64 units out of total 68 units yeah huge area saving but much much more complex much less noise immune so what do we do we say okay and much less noise immune additionally uh the rise time and fall times are very very skewed and everything so then the idea was okay let us do one thing where we say that during an active cycle i will have an additional pmos which would turn on so what does this cmos do during the rise time it would take it up fast but when the system is falling after the so initially it will fall to only say uh let us say vdd by f4 but then once this pmos goes off enable goes high again then this would fall to zero almost zero because this is very resistive huh we can do that hello yeah so what do you want in the earlier case we saw that first if i keep the pmos to be very resistance my rise time would be very bad okay the 16 percent and five percent is fine i am not worried so to get a good rise time what do i want i wanted the pmos to be 2k but with 2k this was the kind of values i was getting on my output unacceptable so what to do so the idea is that in parallel to this nk resistance put another resistance and put another p mass which is slightly larger so that effective pmos resistance is now 2k okay now when the evaluation is on so this pmos will be on only during the evaluation period when the evaluation is on it will my effective pmos resistance is only 2k so the rise will also be fast but once the evaluation closes i would come to this 10k scenario huh and then my output would be at five percent vdd and sixteen percent degree so i get the best of both worlds are you able to see this now so what we would have to add some logic for any equal signal also yes but that you can you know my circuit is to be evaluated i am now evaluating my combinational circuit so at a global level you can add one signal okay at a global level you add one signal but overall you're safe so at the vo at the output i want the exact video to appear so this 16 and five percent i shouldn't get now i mean i should get the exact bdd no but uh vdd you will get yeah but i'm getting with this variation like five percent and 16 percent yeah that is dependent on inputs that is the that is the challenge with ratio logic but even 16 of vdd which means it will still be considered as zero much lower than vd by two okay and are much lower than vdd by two and the other case is where the problem is so what do you mean by a validation phase exactly sir now what do you think i mean [Music] should it be when uh when should my nmos be at higher logic when do we sorry when do we want our output to change i don't know imagine logically i have not used a term which you do not know in english you know and english meaning evaluation whenever we want our output to be 0 or 1 according to the circuit definition i want my output to be zero and one at all times right now because otherwise there will be large amounts of current flowing yes so something else what else could be enabled for what else would this evaluation mean anyone else who can help fashion of their what do you think evaluation would mean the charging discharging phase the transition time of the like the charging and the discharging when it's happening okay that is the evaluation that is the time when your gate is and getting transitions at inputs and you want to evaluate what is the output yes i think so i know so in a synchronous system when the clock comes that is when most of the gates toggle that is in most of the inputs will travel because the flip flop will give the outputs only at that time otherwise flip-flops should also have their output stable is it not yes yes yes so you can say after the clock comes i will have a 20 or 200 pico second enable pulse so that all the combinational gates in my system would evaluate can it be done yes so that is what we mean yes thank you so adaptive load means that during the evaluation phase you have additional pmos which is turned on so that rise wherever signals have to rise they can rise quickly because the output of this signal s this gate s has to go elsewhere also is it not so there is a path we're just not designing one gate we are designing a path so wherever this goes then it will do its own action there so i have a doubt that we are switching the enable pmos right and we are saying that it is it has to be much larger than m2 but i thought that since m2 is the one which is always on and during the the falling phase to save the leakage m2 should be larger since m1 will be off then during the static phase when nothing is working no when the m when we need the low output then so you do not know what the inputs are now because if you do not know the inputs how can you tell the outputs you can always tell whether it is an evaluation phase or not no sir my doubt is suppose uh a one of the input is high and back step back uh this is a nor gate for input nor gate if you have to make the control of this pmos based on the inputs itself then you are actually going for a static cmos implementation aren't you right you will have to put a gate to generate enable signal now okay the entire effort is to save area right irrespective of any input change okay clock comes you generate input you generate enables because you know now evaluations have to happen so we just need to save the rise delay in this case and saving area also yeah not leakage liquid is not the focus here no leakage is saved because in the static case now only m2 is on see if why wouldn't you have gotten too much larger okay had you made m2 much larger static power would have increased significantly light ship now you actually save leakage by this method without compromising on rise time you've done both now right right got it good okay thank you is this point clear to everyone so so in effect we are trying to basically uh with this effort we are trying to uh make the delays again seem like the rise to the equal to the following year this is what yes yes yes yes that is what our attempt is that is what our attempt is that rise time and fall rise delay and fall delay should be almost equal because if they are not then at a system level you have to you put in a huge penalty in terms of managing setups and holds yes so because earlier the fault was already less so we had to make yes okay so this is the adaptive load then this is very interesting this is same kind of circuit but instead of putting this pmos to be always on you you are making a differential output logic huh you're making a differential output logic where you say that instead of pmos being controlled statically by a uh at zero or something and then me putting two p mosses in parallel adaptive load vegeta whatever if i anyway need both the polarities of an input of an output huh if i already need both the polarities of an output then let me use this dc vsl logic where what happens we actually get full zero and we we actually get full ones and also full zeros because why suppose out bar has to go to one when our bar has to go to one what happens uh this pmos will turn off so out will go to a clean zero outgoing to clean zero means this p mass is fully on and this one will be strengthened so noise immunity is also recovered and you also save area you can have these m1 and m2 large enough so that delays for rising and falling are similar are you able to see this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QtpUhabV-A,"Link:

Transcript: our combinational logic where we talk about what kind of combinational logic we would be interested to look at for example ratio logic so long back so see one thing is one thing one challenge is static cmos is that for n number of inputs you have two n number of devices huh and of those two hand devices also the pmos that is the half of those two end devices and devices are also larger are you able to see this in a nand gate two input nand gate how many devices do we have two input nand gate how many devices do we have what is four devices in a nor gate how many do we have to input nor gate again four so at least two n devices are there in static cmos and what about the size of nmos and pmos there and the nor gate the pmos size is four times that of the nmr size and an and gate is it is equivalent to nmr size in a two input nand gate so what do we do now we want to look for ah is there a way to reduce the total number of devices why do we want to reduce the total number of devices what's the importance of reducing number of devices area reductions yes and in vlsi area is we want to save gold so we want to reduce area come whatever may so now we will look at a few methods a few techniques to reduce area by for example in this particular slide you will see completely doing away with the pull-up network for example so what do i do instead of all those p mosses i will just put one resistive load what's the problem with one resistive load fabrication is difficult okay so when you say that instead of static cmos i will put any other load whether it is resistive load or depletion load or pmos load since that load is always on since that load is always on what happens we will observe leakage we will observe continuous static current from vdd to vss and different types of designs were proposed resistive loads so in technologies when pmosses were not available then resistive loads or depletion loads were the only options to be used once the pmoses started to become available then pmos loads were used but these pmos loads were always on now we just saw that by using these always on loads or resistances and depletion loads what is the challenge that we expect that the output will not go to pure zero it cannot because pmos is always on some current some current will come either from rl or the pmos or the diffusion load that we have put are you with me on this any questions still here hello you can put a plus one or something in the chat window if you don't want to unmute and speak now i will not move forward until i get a feedback is that one thing sir if the load is big enough then we can obtain kind of a clear zero yes so what will be the challenge then if the road is suppose this resistive load is very resistant then i will get an almost good zero but what is the challenge i said current will be low charging would be charging current will be less so when i have to take f to one that will be very slow are you able to see this the charging will be very slow then so you cannot really keep the resistance to be extremely high also and moreover if you want to keep the resistance to be very high if you have a real resistance there then that resistance will take a lot of area if you have a pmos there or a depletion load there okay area may not be that much impacted but you will have in all the three cases whether it is resistance or transistors you will have much larger rise times so one thing we already discussed that the noise margin would degrade the low voltage will not be zero low voltage will be in the ratio of a resistance of the p network upon resistance of the the resistance of the resistance of the pull down network upon resistance of the pull down network plus rl huh and the propagation delay will also in the in the case of uh rising be dependent on rl so if you make very large resistance then the rise time will be very very large so this is not really a good way to design but you see we save lots of area so we may want to design it somewhere so these are the active loads where we have in this case nmos only technology and in this case a pmos load so in our technologies we always have pmos so we may want to do it like this but we see that there are obvious challenges if for example i have a pseudo pima pseudo nmos design where they have a pmos load because it is small and everything i have a pmos load then what happens then when just one of these inputs is on the other three are off at that point of time the current that is sunk from here will be or you know the ratio of current sunk from here or the resistance of the pmos stack and the ratio of the nmos stack resistance of the nmr stack will be such that my vol will be different so you will see that uh as my more and more transistors in that uh nor gate turn on huh i will get a no this i will get a better zero so are you able to see this not exactly why v is changing here okay so let us say the pmos resistance is 10k huh and nmos resistance is uh also 10k let us say 10k angle let us say nmos resistance is 2k each of these nmoses has resistance 2k so when all four of my n masses are on what is the effective and mass resistance [Music] so what is the value of uh vol approximately okay yes approximately vdd by 19. uh we need by 21. almost even more than 5 percent of vdd taken now let us say only one of them is on then what is happening are you able to see this yes hello but why won't we for example if we know that we are using a pseudo nmos then we can design our females also to be that equivalent resistance like happiness tell me your value how much would you want the pmos resistance to be finally ideally you would want equivalent to equal resistance on pmos and nmr so that you have almost equal delays for rise and fall yes sir so manitoba i have made it 10k whereas nmoses are 2k so my rise time will be 5 times more than fall time already [Music] you propose what number would you want to use let us use that i have no problem let us find out what that number tell me so if we use 2k for the pinocchio yes let us use 2k for the pmos then what happens when all the four outputs are one okay it will not work for you okay are you able to see this yes so when we do so what this also means is that when we do ratio logic design pseudo nmr pseudo pmos the way we size the nmos and pmos how does a very significant impact on vol and all those things and that is what is shown in this slide that as you size your pmos up what happens you reduce the pmos resistance but my vol reduced my fault time increased significantly are you able to see this this is exactly the same discussion you were having just now yes so uh not very interesting very complex you know in the sense that if while we save area we save a lot of area actually all the p mosses are gone anna so in that nor gate imagine the p mosses would have if the nmos is sized one the pmos would have been sized it's a four input thing huh what would happen the size of the p moses hello four times the size four times eight times sixteen times six four fifteen sixteen four input thing yeah anna so 16 into four you have saved how much 64 units out of total 68 units yeah huge area saving but much much more complex much less noise immune so what do we do we say okay and much less noise immune additionally uh the rise time and fall times are very very skewed and everything so then the idea was okay let us do one thing where we say that during an active cycle i will have an additional pmos which would turn on so what does this cmos do during the rise time it would take it up fast but when the system is falling after the so initially it will fall to only say uh let us say vdd by f4 but then once this pmos goes off enable goes high again then this would fall to zero almost zero because this is very resistive huh we can do that hello yeah so what do you want in the earlier case we saw that first if i keep the pmos to be very resistance my rise time would be very bad okay the 16 percent and five percent is fine i am not worried so to get a good rise time what do i want i wanted the pmos to be 2k but with 2k this was the kind of values i was getting on my output unacceptable so what to do so the idea is that in parallel to this nk resistance put another resistance and put another p mass which is slightly larger so that effective pmos resistance is now 2k okay now when the evaluation is on so this pmos will be on only during the evaluation period when the evaluation is on it will my effective pmos resistance is only 2k so the rise will also be fast but once the evaluation closes i would come to this 10k scenario huh and then my output would be at five percent vdd and sixteen percent degree so i get the best of both worlds are you able to see this now so what we would have to add some logic for any equal signal also yes but that you can you know my circuit is to be evaluated i am now evaluating my combinational circuit so at a global level you can add one signal okay at a global level you add one signal but overall you're safe so at the vo at the output i want the exact video to appear so this 16 and five percent i shouldn't get now i mean i should get the exact bdd no but uh vdd you will get yeah but i'm getting with this variation like five percent and 16 percent yeah that is dependent on inputs that is the that is the challenge with ratio logic but even 16 of vdd which means it will still be considered as zero much lower than vd by two okay and are much lower than vdd by two and the other case is where the problem is so what do you mean by a validation phase exactly sir now what do you think i mean [Music] should it be when uh when should my nmos be at higher logic when do we sorry when do we want our output to change i don't know imagine logically i have not used a term which you do not know in english you know and english meaning evaluation whenever we want our output to be 0 or 1 according to the circuit definition i want my output to be zero and one at all times right now because otherwise there will be large amounts of current flowing yes so something else what else could be enabled for what else would this evaluation mean anyone else who can help fashion of their what do you think evaluation would mean the charging discharging phase the transition time of the like the charging and the discharging when it's happening okay that is the evaluation that is the time when your gate is and getting transitions at inputs and you want to evaluate what is the output yes i think so i know so in a synchronous system when the clock comes that is when most of the gates toggle that is in most of the inputs will travel because the flip flop will give the outputs only at that time otherwise flip-flops should also have their output stable is it not yes yes yes so you can say after the clock comes i will have a 20 or 200 pico second enable pulse so that all the combinational gates in my system would evaluate can it be done yes so that is what we mean yes thank you so adaptive load means that during the evaluation phase you have additional pmos which is turned on so that rise wherever signals have to rise they can rise quickly because the output of this signal s this gate s has to go elsewhere also is it not so there is a path we're just not designing one gate we are designing a path so wherever this goes then it will do its own action there so i have a doubt that we are switching the enable pmos right and we are saying that it is it has to be much larger than m2 but i thought that since m2 is the one which is always on and during the the falling phase to save the leakage m2 should be larger since m1 will be off then during the static phase when nothing is working no when the m when we need the low output then so you do not know what the inputs are now because if you do not know the inputs how can you tell the outputs you can always tell whether it is an evaluation phase or not no sir my doubt is suppose uh a one of the input is high and back step back uh this is a nor gate for input nor gate if you have to make the control of this pmos based on the inputs itself then you are actually going for a static cmos implementation aren't you right you will have to put a gate to generate enable signal now okay the entire effort is to save area right irrespective of any input change okay clock comes you generate input you generate enables because you know now evaluations have to happen so we just need to save the rise delay in this case and saving area also yeah not leakage liquid is not the focus here no leakage is saved because in the static case now only m2 is on see if why wouldn't you have gotten too much larger okay had you made m2 much larger static power would have increased significantly light ship now you actually save leakage by this method without compromising on rise time you've done both now right right got it good okay thank you is this point clear to everyone so so in effect we are trying to basically uh with this effort we are trying to uh make the delays again seem like the rise to the equal to the following year this is what yes yes yes yes that is what our attempt is that is what our attempt is that rise time and fall rise delay and fall delay should be almost equal because if they are not then at a system level you have to you put in a huge penalty in terms of managing setups and holds yes so because earlier the fault was already less so we had to make yes okay so this is the adaptive load then this is very interesting this is same kind of circuit but instead of putting this pmos to be always on you you are making a differential output logic huh you're making a differential output logic where you say that instead of pmos being controlled statically by a uh at zero or something and then me putting two p mosses in parallel adaptive load vegeta whatever if i anyway need both the polarities of an input of an output huh if i already need both the polarities of an output then let me use this dc vsl logic where what happens we actually get full zero and we we actually get full ones and also full zeros because why suppose out bar has to go to one when our bar has to go to one what happens uh this pmos will turn off so out will go to a clean zero outgoing to clean zero means this p mass is fully on and this one will be strengthened so noise immunity is also recovered and you also save area you can have these m1 and m2 large enough so that delays for rising and falling are similar are you able to see this"

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,i7zDhLsk9i4,transistor logic some of you are designing your gates projects in pass transistor logic who all are doing it in ptl put a plus five in the chat window no one huh no one is designing using ptr that is of the few people who are in class today why is the clustering so low today any ideas midsummer ended last week so we can probably have a surprise quiz in the class sometime let us see so uh maybe there is some documentary notification today for some people um is it the case for some of you so some of you are expected to be on campus today am i right is that the expectation because even on even on wednesday the class strength was low okay no problems so uh a past transistor logic says that we'd so you know in the static cmos and in this ratio logic also we had these d masses and we had these constraints of how big the pmos should be what should be the ratio of the pmos stack under nmr stack and so on we had all these things the questions comes can i design only within most transistors no pmos at all especially you know in 1970s and 80s the mosses were not even there so everything had to be designed with an unmasked logic so what do i do if i have to design with nmos logic because if i have only nmos logic then there is no vdd to ground connection also so there will be no static power consumption and that is where we talk about past transistor logic where n masses are used as switches n masses are used as switches you may say so what do you do you make a switch network and then you simply buffer the output okay so in in this kind of a network an and gate would be designed simply like this are you able to see this that this is and functionality can you work it out for yourself hello this is okay and functionality is clear now the beauty of pass transistor logic is that you can have and functionality also and you can have nand functionality also so you no longer are limited to inverted output suppose in as in a static cmos or even studio cmos if you wanted a and gate to be implemented you will first implement a nand gate and then you will implement then we will add an inverter over here that is not required at all just two nmoses and you have and functionality then what is the challenge the challenge so as we said you put something and then add the output you put a buffer the challenge is that now this in let us say this n goes from 0 to 1 if n goes from 0 to 1 this nmos turns on it charges up vx and output goes to zero so you get the output as zero but what about x x is at what value what will be the value that x will be at so when n is going to be minus gravity minus v v d minus v t so what happens to this the current of this inverter now what happens to the current of this inverter now sir what do you mean by current exactly sir output current sir what do you mean by current of an inverter it's a load which it supplies the current to the load which is only that do you mean only that when you talk of current current from the vdd yeah so what happens to the current from vdd over here that is what my question is so sub threshold starts from pmos and something more maybe now the pmos is not slowly off yes so the pmos current or the sub threshold current or the static current that will flow will not be zero you tell me i have this inverter the input is less so what is happening this is vdd minus vt so you're just at the boundary of threshold voltage for the p mass v mass is off but there is still static power and a significant amount of static current happening nmos is fully on that you are able to see so nmos is fully on pmos is off but not fully off so there is a significant amount of static current coming from here which would be sunk here now the ratio of this just off pmos resistance of just of pmos and the resistance of a fully on nmos that ratio is such that you are still getting an almost zero at the output that is a different thing but do you realize that there will be that that will be a very high sub threshold current flowing over here are you able to see that sir how can we say that my nmos is fully answered you tell me that as my input is not when uh touching the one position when does nmos enter into saturation region when my uh okay video should be greater than vs minus vtc is it greater than vgs minus vp what is the vt that you see in this photo vt is the between things uh x2 output between gap what is that value that's vt uh there is about x axis is labeled and one one almost one i think yeah so let us say 1 yes so what is vds minus vt then when x is equal to 1.5 x equal to 1.5 it's pointless so vds minus vp is greater than zero okay okay sir yeah yes yeah it is in saturation yes it is i know see you have to okay so this is one thing that i am observing in the class uh you're not using your uh you know the logic that you that has already been taught to you earlier to arrive at a analysis to do some analysis you're waiting for either me to analyze it for you or someone else to analyze it for you this is not right please use your knowledge that already you have to quickly do this mental estimation now i have no problem in helping you but the problem is if you continuously look at me whenever you become independent you are more than halfway through the class through the course at this point this value that is this greater than vds minus vp should i be helping you solve this no sir so please at least try to become independent again you make mistakes you ask questions no problems unless you make mistakes how will you learn i have no problems with you making mistakes but at least this analysis you do and then say sir point five off the credit why are you saying it is on instead of saying why are you saying it is on you tell me why do you think it is off and then we will review again but you ask me to arrive it for you that is not right when will you become independent so ask as many questions no problems validate as many doubts clarify as many doubts but this is not a doubt this is something you not even tried to solve something and you are asking a question this is not right are you able to see this yes so if we have if you have uh nmrs only logic while we started now you remember when we started the ptl we said there will be no static currents you remember this on that slide we had written no static current but what did we just see there is all of us are done all the static current that is happening there are you able to see this so we started ptl with no static current hypothesis but we just realized there is going to be static current in ptl also so what to do now so like i was thinking like instead of like we are implementing our combinational logic using ptl and then we are using this inverter for the buffer uh but if we okay but can't we implement this uh inverter also like in ptl logic itself like if we put this simple nmos and then connect the x to that gate also like okay how will you take it to vdd then output to be ready then i mean like so then that x is on so vddt will be basically it will fight we will try let us try why why not you know no this is a good question because this is still exploratory this is a good question no problems in handling this question let us see i see easy example may let us see what happens when uh i want to make inverter through a pass gate so what are we saying we are saying uh for an inverter you would put the input over here or no for an for an inverter then what you would need to do you would need to say that either i will put input over here so input is 1 output should be 0 and i will put 0 over here it got stuck let me go to whiteboards i'm able to do something not able to write i am not able to write on the screen um so what are we saying we are saying that there is a and put vdd now over here it was a vx and we now say that this vx will put somewhere so that i get the inversion there i get a full vdu to ground swing there that is the purpose of putting an inverter are you are you with me on this why do we put an inverter in the first place because i want a full zero to vdd swing yes now tell me how to design a ptl based inverter i can take this vx to a gate of an nmos yes and i will store a 0 over here so my output will go to zero over like this but when the output has to go to one how how will i put this nmos how do i what configuration should i use yeah then we have to put the vdd but then also it will be introduced okay you're saying vdd so what is the benefit now if i put vdd over here what happens now the gate is at vx yes what will i get over here vdd minus the two threshold yes yeah so can you do it so one more special drop because the earlier and this okay are you able to see this so 2 y 2 is coming exactly so one vt drop because of this yes sir yeah one vt drop had already happened here yeah yes so you see this doesn't work you will have to use an inverter

Transcript: transistor logic some of you are designing your gates projects in pass transistor logic who all are doing it in ptl put a plus five in the chat window no one huh no one is designing using ptr that is of the few people who are in class today why is the clustering so low today any ideas midsummer ended last week so we can probably have a surprise quiz in the class sometime let us see so uh maybe there is some documentary notification today for some people um is it the case for some of you so some of you are expected to be on campus today am i right is that the expectation because even on even on wednesday the class strength was low okay no problems so uh a past transistor logic says that we'd so you know in the static cmos and in this ratio logic also we had these d masses and we had these constraints of how big the pmos should be what should be the ratio of the pmos stack under nmr stack and so on we had all these things the questions comes can i design only within most transistors no pmos at all especially you know in 1970s and 80s the mosses were not even there so everything had to be designed with an unmasked logic so what do i do if i have to design with nmos logic because if i have only nmos logic then there is no vdd to ground connection also so there will be no static power consumption and that is where we talk about past transistor logic where n masses are used as switches n masses are used as switches you may say so what do you do you make a switch network and then you simply buffer the output okay so in in this kind of a network an and gate would be designed simply like this are you able to see this that this is and functionality can you work it out for yourself hello this is okay and functionality is clear now the beauty of pass transistor logic is that you can have and functionality also and you can have nand functionality also so you no longer are limited to inverted output suppose in as in a static cmos or even studio cmos if you wanted a and gate to be implemented you will first implement a nand gate and then you will implement then we will add an inverter over here that is not required at all just two nmoses and you have and functionality then what is the challenge the challenge so as we said you put something and then add the output you put a buffer the challenge is that now this in let us say this n goes from 0 to 1 if n goes from 0 to 1 this nmos turns on it charges up vx and output goes to zero so you get the output as zero but what about x x is at what value what will be the value that x will be at so when n is going to be minus gravity minus v v d minus v t so what happens to this the current of this inverter now what happens to the current of this inverter now sir what do you mean by current exactly sir output current sir what do you mean by current of an inverter it's a load which it supplies the current to the load which is only that do you mean only that when you talk of current current from the vdd yeah so what happens to the current from vdd over here that is what my question is so sub threshold starts from pmos and something more maybe now the pmos is not slowly off yes so the pmos current or the sub threshold current or the static current that will flow will not be zero you tell me i have this inverter the input is less so what is happening this is vdd minus vt so you're just at the boundary of threshold voltage for the p mass v mass is off but there is still static power and a significant amount of static current happening nmos is fully on that you are able to see so nmos is fully on pmos is off but not fully off so there is a significant amount of static current coming from here which would be sunk here now the ratio of this just off pmos resistance of just of pmos and the resistance of a fully on nmos that ratio is such that you are still getting an almost zero at the output that is a different thing but do you realize that there will be that that will be a very high sub threshold current flowing over here are you able to see that sir how can we say that my nmos is fully answered you tell me that as my input is not when uh touching the one position when does nmos enter into saturation region when my uh okay video should be greater than vs minus vtc is it greater than vgs minus vp what is the vt that you see in this photo vt is the between things uh x2 output between gap what is that value that's vt uh there is about x axis is labeled and one one almost one i think yeah so let us say 1 yes so what is vds minus vt then when x is equal to 1.5 x equal to 1.5 it's pointless so vds minus vp is greater than zero okay okay sir yeah yes yeah it is in saturation yes it is i know see you have to okay so this is one thing that i am observing in the class uh you're not using your uh you know the logic that you that has already been taught to you earlier to arrive at a analysis to do some analysis you're waiting for either me to analyze it for you or someone else to analyze it for you this is not right please use your knowledge that already you have to quickly do this mental estimation now i have no problem in helping you but the problem is if you continuously look at me whenever you become independent you are more than halfway through the class through the course at this point this value that is this greater than vds minus vp should i be helping you solve this no sir so please at least try to become independent again you make mistakes you ask questions no problems unless you make mistakes how will you learn i have no problems with you making mistakes but at least this analysis you do and then say sir point five off the credit why are you saying it is on instead of saying why are you saying it is on you tell me why do you think it is off and then we will review again but you ask me to arrive it for you that is not right when will you become independent so ask as many questions no problems validate as many doubts clarify as many doubts but this is not a doubt this is something you not even tried to solve something and you are asking a question this is not right are you able to see this yes so if we have if you have uh nmrs only logic while we started now you remember when we started the ptl we said there will be no static currents you remember this on that slide we had written no static current but what did we just see there is all of us are done all the static current that is happening there are you able to see this so we started ptl with no static current hypothesis but we just realized there is going to be static current in ptl also so what to do now so like i was thinking like instead of like we are implementing our combinational logic using ptl and then we are using this inverter for the buffer uh but if we okay but can't we implement this uh inverter also like in ptl logic itself like if we put this simple nmos and then connect the x to that gate also like okay how will you take it to vdd then output to be ready then i mean like so then that x is on so vddt will be basically it will fight we will try let us try why why not you know no this is a good question because this is still exploratory this is a good question no problems in handling this question let us see i see easy example may let us see what happens when uh i want to make inverter through a pass gate so what are we saying we are saying uh for an inverter you would put the input over here or no for an for an inverter then what you would need to do you would need to say that either i will put input over here so input is 1 output should be 0 and i will put 0 over here it got stuck let me go to whiteboards i'm able to do something not able to write i am not able to write on the screen um so what are we saying we are saying that there is a and put vdd now over here it was a vx and we now say that this vx will put somewhere so that i get the inversion there i get a full vdu to ground swing there that is the purpose of putting an inverter are you are you with me on this why do we put an inverter in the first place because i want a full zero to vdd swing yes now tell me how to design a ptl based inverter i can take this vx to a gate of an nmos yes and i will store a 0 over here so my output will go to zero over like this but when the output has to go to one how how will i put this nmos how do i what configuration should i use yeah then we have to put the vdd but then also it will be introduced okay you're saying vdd so what is the benefit now if i put vdd over here what happens now the gate is at vx yes what will i get over here vdd minus the two threshold yes yeah so can you do it so one more special drop because the earlier and this okay are you able to see this so 2 y 2 is coming exactly so one vt drop because of this yes sir yeah one vt drop had already happened here yeah yes so you see this doesn't work you will have to use an inverter there"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,Db9HZv9Wc8s,you can anything else that is not clear yet hello so what is the challenge now we said that there will be no leakage but there is leakage happening huh so what to do we need to design something differently so we say that uh so this vt loss thing we just now saw okay you're able to see this this vt losses is exactly what we saw just now any questions on the vt loss part so like uh for the static only for example we are you are saying that uh we are saying the vdd here as 2.5 volt but as we for example scale to low technology nodes this leakage would reduce because this vdd is decreasing so on that also if we are basically so you tell me you're reducing the voltage okay so you're reducing the voltage to let us say one volt yes sir threshold voltage would be 0.5 yes sir so at b you will have 0.5 which is v d by 2 what would you make of that yeah so in advanced technologies it actually becomes burst yeah okay so now what we say is so let us put a level restorer so after the inverter we put a pmos a small p mass and we have a level restorer and this what does this level restorer do it ensures that vx goes to vdd when v out is 0 vx goes to 0 to vdd and therefore there is no static current from the inverter but what has happened to make this gate you already now have four transistors are you able to see this so you already have two v moses now you wanted to do away with the team of three monsters all together but already you have two p mosses now additionally uh this additional transistor mr is a like and load on the output and you again have the same problem of ratio of the strength of mr versus mn you want to try something from a but this mr is on it will not let your v x to go zero go to zero are you able to see this suppose you want to drive x to zero it was initially one if x was initially one then out was zero outbound zero means mr is fully on now you want to drive x to one x to zero you want to sing that current through a what happens the amount of current you sing through a a much more amount or some amount would be coming from mr so this is again the same ratio problem that you were looking at in the earlier ratio logic paradigm are you able to see this any questions so the principle of uh clearly solder is basically the positive feedback kind of kind of half latch yes so what if we change sizes of mrna so now you have to do the sizing none you have see in static cmos did you ever have to do sizing for your vol or voh purpose no no you only did sizing for your delay purpose over here we are saying we need to do sizing for functionality itself are you able to see this yes sir so now i will uh somewhat decrease size of mr yes now you want mr to be resistive yes huh so mr has to be as result just like over there pmos had to the pmos and the ratio logic had to be as small as possible so that you could take as close to 0 as possible over here mr has to be as resistive as possible it just is there to restore from vx to vdd take from vx to vdd that is the only purpose so keep it as small as possible typically this restorer device would be the smallest pmos that you could design in a technology smallest and that too with large length okay so having different links doesn't have any problem with having different lengths length yeah if the length is minimum then the current from mr will be high oh i am reducing the width you've already reduced the width yes you are the minimum width but if you want it to be still more resistive what do you do you increase the length yeah so what i am saying is size it appropriately you may not need to increase the rent but yes so what length are you using there here i am talking digital like most people are talking about so has anyone tied your hands that you don't have to touch length then it is an assumption you are making i am telling you increase the length i think that opening the length would not only be like uh we are not going to deliver many things will change i think yeah let them what all will change let's look at that what always change if you increase the length first of all everything the power also will change which power i mean dissipation participation also will get impacted i think so yeah which power dissipation static or dynamic we know everything now we know all the different static power is gate leakage brain leakage junction leakage we know all those components also so tell me which one if you increase the length which power would increase switching with switching in this particular circuit with switching power would increase the switching of out because you've added an additional capacitor on out am i right yes so that will increase so what how what has length got to do with it anyways it was this mr you are putting you increase the length by 10 percent that capacitance increased by further 10 so it's a minuscule change in overall power but probably you are not now worried about ratio logic design your overall delay may reduce that can happen yes if you make mr more resistors then a to x transition a to x movement will be much faster because now mr is not really playing much role it is only playing a role very slowly so that vx does not remain at the at vdd minus vt level vx gets recharged to vdd and that it can do at leisure output is already there are you able to see this sir one thing just i wanted to ask that from x to the gate of mr there would be always some inherent delay because there is an inverter now let's let's say my input was a one then i suddenly switched to zero and for some time won't we be observing a shot between vdd why do we want mr to be small this is exactly what we are talking about certain dynamic power would be increasing again yeah it would increase it would take some extra time to because mr current has to be sung through a that is not just dynamic power all the current of mr in that period will have to be sung through it okay so if this mr is very large then you will never be able to write 0 on x instead the thing is actually in static cmos we never observed a short between input pin and supply pin yes so see the challenge here so this is a big challenge over here now your input pin you cannot control it also you see he affected my supply yes yes you see this is such a big challenge so later you will see as we move forward you will see that inputs at least trip level inputs or block level inputs can never come to pass transistor logic not allowed because some other circuit is driving and over here you have put ppl and this ptl logic because of the virtue of it being ptl starts to back drive the inputs the system would go no macro level inputs can ever be driven uh or can ever be taken to a ttl logic simply not allowed you will see you will see this in detail later but so i'm happy that you've taken us to that point but uh is this level restorer concept here because we will use this in dynamic gates also so just here so for example all the techniques that we have studied like the logical effort they won't be we won't be able to apply here also no right no logical effort is for static schemas these are techniques we are just trying to save area once you've done everything else now you say okay let me recover area so some places you say okay i will use this ptl some places you will say i will use this dc vsl and all those things but here we are saving the area equivalent to only two transistors yeah moving on so but see in this particular you're just talking about one gate then yes but if you think of a mux so this is the impact of restorating if the restorer is very large then this is where your output is but if the restorer is small enough then it it works okay so this is okay what you need to really look for is that if you have two inverters for example driving this this particular gate there could be current paths that could form between them okay so it's not it's not easy you have to be extremely careful when you use ptl that is why i said these inputs cannot be coming from outside the macro if you really have these two inverters the input should be like coming here then whatever current it is you will be able to characterize within your valid verification process itself okay so what do you do we had this vt drop and everything to avoid vt drop you instead of pass gates you use transmission gates now what happens whether the input is zero or one you will be able to transmit a to b at one point of time nmos will be on at another point of time pmos will be on are you able to see this instead of etl use transmission gate logic hello so now you know you no longer need this is by adding one more transistor yeah but you no longer need the level restorer do you see that yes huh you no longer read the revolver restorer and just to get you do not even actually need to put the inverters there if you do not have to drive a very large load you just wanted to put the inverter just so that you have a clear zero and one output you no longer need that inverter also so this is better so then why choose pasta and sister nausea i'm sorry then why juice why do we choose past time system we can because in some places would work no but transmission is better yeah but at some places in some places you only need to transmit a zero for example in the bit lines of a of a memory when you want to write into the memory you only transmit a 0 that is the only transition that you are interested in when you want to write into the memory so why then user transmission get why waste area area is gold are you able to see this yes so it depends on application which i mean yes so all these exotic styles uh skewed gates uh asymmetric dates symmetric gates all these exotic styles this ratio logic ptl all these exotic styles are to be used only on specific use cases but when you have those specific use cases you should have the library you should have the mental space to say okay i have studied about this let me use this logic here that is why we are discussing this in the class are you able to see this hello yes it is if you have a transmission gate multiple base multiplexer you can actually get a very good multiplexer out of it very quickly no challenges a transmission gate zord is also very dense just look at it be careful this is not ground this is b bar this is not vdd this is b huh these are these appear to be very nice designs but realize that these a and b are now signals so this b is not stable b bar is not stable at zero this b bar might also be rising or might just be falling so the delays are not in your control at all this looks to be a very dense design for his or gate but try implementing it try characterizing it and you're in for a toss unless you have the world of time you can't use this design so even if this file if it is in the middle of some design then i can control the signals i can control my launcher okay so transmission gate okay let us assume that there is a huge series of transmission gates that i have what do i essentially have then i have a large rc network and my delays degrade humongously so what do we need to do we need to put buffers intermittently okay we need to put these buffers intermittently otherwise this is a very huge r equivalent that you will see see each r in itself is small but because you have a multitude of these hours it's like a you know stack of p mosses or a stack of nmoses so you either need to size these transmission gates up significantly or you just simply put buffers after say five stages or ten stages or whatever is appropriate for you for that particular technology okay so transmission getting both eye problem solved but not everything are you with me yes this will be a regular cmos for two inverters but you still save lots of cmos lots of logic area any questions here hmm not participating not speaking nothing is happening friends you see what happening no response today so if you have this kind of a if you have this kind of a transmission gate chain then what do you do you can actually calculate the delay so if there is no buffer then this will be the kind of delay because the total number of resistance will be n into you know you add all those resistances but if you put in a buffer then you will come to some optimal number there is some delay of the buffer and then limited delay of the chain so you arrive at an m optimal total number of stages after which you should put a buffer okay are you able to see this i mean like uh i think that most where exactly are we using this like kind of these esoteric like kind of circuits because yes the transmission database circuits transmission gateway circuits could be used at many places because they will help you implement even complex logic with lesser number of transistors okay it's like instead of etl you're using uh switches of transmission gates but then the early issue was that a signal that that is a very very big issue and i think yeah but that was for this or gate no no don't get confused that was only for this all gate for other gates it will not be like that it can be but not much zorg it was a challenge solve it was designed like this or gate as design like that appears to be very dense but it's a pin it's a pain to design it now but like for the other gates itself for example my uh suppose the b signal and the device signal it would be coming from some other kind of logic so then it would also be facing some kind of degradation and this view of that signal would change and so how would i be able to characterize that theo in terms of [Music] what do you say when you're talking about it in terms of uh that is a different thing all other gates will still be able to manage okay fairly well okay so um if we if we go to a buffered transmission gate chain do you realize that there is a may a simple method to arrive at what is the optimal number of stages after which you want to put a buffer is this thing evident to you yes sir great so with that we kind of come to a close of this ptl kind of logic design also okay and now we start with what is called as dynamic logic so what do you understand by dynamic logic so i was i was just into,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db9HZv9Wc8s,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db9HZv9Wc8s

big issue and i think yeah but that was for this or gate no no don't get confused that was only for this all gate for other gates it will not be like that it can be but not much zorg it was a challenge solve it was designed like this or gate as design like that appears to be very dense but it's a pin it's a pain to design it now but like for the other gates itself for example my uh suppose the b signal and the device signal it would be coming from some other kind of logic so then it would also be facing some kind of degradation and this view of that signal would change and so how would i be able to characterize that theo in terms of [Music] what do you say when you're talking about it in terms of uh that is a different thing all other gates will still be able to manage okay fairly well okay so um if we if we go to a buffered transmission gate chain do you realize that there is a may a simple method to arrive at what is the optimal number of stages after which you want to put a buffer is this thing evident to you yes sir great so with that we kind of come to a close of this ptl kind of logic design also okay and now we start with what is called as dynamic logic so what do you understand by dynamic logic so i was i was just into"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,fz09Zx1PLOg,it's almost time so we'll close the class but what do you mean by dynamic logic dynamic means something is moving something is i think something is moving something there's movement it's not right so when we are using the clock then we are using a clock yes so the dynamic circuits for example since let us look at it like this in static circuits what are you doing at every point of time except when switching output is connected to either vdd or ground why a low resistance path because there is a pull up stack and a pull down stack in dynamic logic the output may actually be connected or lefty left floating so you are depending on storage of output on some capacitance okay so what does this mean this means that you have for example a dynamic gate and you have a clock also going to it now when ck is equal to 0 then what happens this pmos is on this nmos is off output goes to 1. this phase is called the pre-charge phase now when you want to evaluate the output of a b and c of this combinational gate when a b and c values are fixed then what happens ck goes to 1 ck goes to 1 means what would happen the pmos would turn off the nmos would turn on m e would turn on m evaluate would turn on and now you will evaluate the the dynamic gate and once evaluated suppose let us say that c is equal to 0 and b is also equal to 0. so the evaluation says that out has to be 1 but clk is 1 so out is now being left floating are you able to see this out is not any longer driven to one out is left floating that is where it is called as dynamic logic are you able to see this so when clock was one then the lower end mosque will will be like open switch so the close switch and so i will have a path yeah and if abc are one then i am saying when c is equal to zero and b is equal to zero okay and abc are one then zero so we consider so as designers we have to look at the worst case what is the worst case the worst case is that your is 1 b 0 c 0 so there is some charge sharing that has happened between these two nodes and there is no way to even recover that charge are you able to see that faulty takedown yes fault delay there was no change in output expected if b is 0 and c 0 there was no change in output expected yes sir but out is now floating out is not driven to 1 because the clk is 1. and there's no path to ground it was not meant to be because if if b is equal to 0 and c is equal to 0 then there was no path to ground there was no it was not meant to be there so what are we saying if let us say there is a glitch on b b was zero but there is a glitch that comes on b a is one what happens now now until the clock goes back to zero again until my recharge phase starts again there is no way to recover out are you able to see this so what are we saying we are saying that there are few conditions that are there on the output that once the output of a gate is discharged it cannot be charged again the inputs to the gate can make at most one transition during an evaluation so if you're talking about a glitch that glitch input going to one it discharged the gate and now the zero input going back to zero will not charge it again so inputs so glitches are absolutely unacceptable in dynamic gates huh then it may not go to zero afternoon if my glitch is very small my output might reduce but it not go to zero directly so what do you mean by a glitch for a short pulse i have a one two zero it goes to one and zero the short is an assumption for me glitch is any spurious transition okay consider adder in the adder ripple carry adders huh these ci is just keep on getting evaluated yes so the ci can go to one for a reasonable amount of time yes but it is still a glitch yes so short was your assumption is it not yes sir i have a very big device even a short glitch can lead to dispatch yes so again as a designer always look at the worst case failure mode when you are designing when you are verifying are you able to see this so we don't we don't want to keep it floating we have to make it somehow to not keep it yes so that is a challenge that we as designers have so what do you think we can do we did something in the static dates what what can we do we had the signals vx going to vdd minus dt or something like that to do it to connect it to vdd we added something what did we do output buffer auto buffer vx clear restorer we made a half latch so the level wrestler restored the level from vx to vdd over here what can we do we can also put a restorer over here so that if there is some charge that has gone because of a glitch or something it can be recovered are you able to see this so what are the properties of dynamic gates first is that the total number of transistors is n plus 2 versus 2n for static c mass huh then you get full swing outputs we're not talking worried about ratio logic just yet you will get full zero and full ones so non-ratio sizing and do you realize that as soon as you reduce the number of transistors that an input goes to you reduce the logical effort since you've reduced the logical effort of the design the overall path delays reduce very very significantly so there is reduced input capacitance there is reduced output capacitance also huh and therefore overall delays are expected to be less additionally now these are positives what is also happening is that even if there is no static paths the problem is that power consumption and these gates will be higher why let us consider a case that let's consider the case of a static nand huh [Music] so this is the last thing that we are doing so let's consider the case of a static nand static a two input map now in the previous cycles a and b were both one so what they had done this output y was discharged but when c k went to zero what happened this output got recharged a and b did not toggle when the next clock came this output will discharge again now there was no toggle in a and b had it been a static inverter a static nand gate would there have been any power consumption but over here i consume power so my activity factor has at once increased very significantly are you able to see this in every cycle i'm discharging and charging the charging and charging so i mean because uh activity factor of the clock is the highest and here it is controlled by the clock itself so yeah with the more spectrum yes massive yes hannah so are you able to see this area uh as soon as there is some glitch on the input signals even a small glitch on the input signals as we just saw the output the the the reliability of the output starts to suffer because once it discharges there is no way to bring it back so in the next class we will look at these restorer concepts and the other concepts which are used so that we are able to use dynamic gates appropriately in our designs okay we'll close the class here you're already at 130. okay sir yes sir can we keep that clock no nmos first and then bdn network okay because because at the output capacitance will be reduced i think okay no problem you can do that we don't usually do that because uh we don't want uh clock see as soon as clock toggles there will be noise on the output again so we don't want that also to happen but it's okay you can do that that's not usually done though so we have the path delegate in that case because my clock is getting in between yeah see in this gate clock has to come first and then other signals will be evaluated okay but if you put it like that a clock on the top even then it's okay because as soon as clock comes other inputs have already been evaluated on the nmr stack and you would give an output you can try that it's not usually done think why what could be the failure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz09Zx1PLOg,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz09Zx1PLOg

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,WrZ2leirJl8,the last class so just started the dynamic we we were introduced we hadn't used the dynamic logic so what is dynamic logic why is it called so because the output is not driven and like always driven and we get a floating kind of output and it depends upon the charge that is stored on the capacitor not always driven so while in static gates we say that uh the output or all the nodes are always driven you do not leave things non-floating in static cmos case in dynamic logic we realized that there is only n stack and on the pima side you have a clock based header and on the at the end of the bottom of the nmr stack you have a clock based footer and you said that this this system uh will lead to a floating gate condition when the remaining nmos stack is off uh the pmos will go off and clock goes high and you will end up having floating output so since that kind of and then at that point of time you are dependent on the charge stored on that floating output to ensure that you are stable that you are robust so that is where it is called as a dynamic due to leakage you will you may need to refresh this so at the end of every clock cycle this this capacitor whether it had discharged or not will again be charged up to vdd okay so we also looked i started to look at the challenges or limitations around dynamic gates what were they sir there is very less noise immunity there is very less noise immunity okay for a particular uh within a single cycle of the clock the inputs can be changed at most once um so the inputs can can change only at most once input can go from zero to one only once if it if there is a glitch then i have a problem okay what else to charge and discharge this the power consumption is high so activity factor is very high so yes activity effect is also very that's something different but yeah activity factor is very high because in in terms of uh when you compare it with a static date even if the even if the inputs have not toggled a static gate would not consume any power but a dynamic gate will always consume power you know because at the end of every evaluation phase there is a precharge phase and in that recharge phase whatever capacitances you had discharged would get recharged all over again what else so we also saw that in dynamic gates the total number of transistors would be something like n plus 2 versus 2 n for the static cmos you're able to see this n plus two the plus two things yes sir the header clock the the pmos with the header clock and the n mass with the footer clock then the good thing about this is so we have lesser number of transistors but much much better situation than let us say ptl or pseudo and mass because the outputs are fulfilling outputs are full string the output is either full vdd and when it has to be zero it will be taken to full ground so outputs are full swing and because outputs are full swing and the nmr stack or pmos stack will is not you know there is no race condition or fight back between the two nmos and pmos traps like in uh pseudo nmos kind of a case the sizing does not really affect the logic levels the sizing affects the delays but it does not affect the logic levels and what also has happened we discussed this also in the last class we've reduced the capacitance with all capacitances have they reduced input all the pmos the most one we reduce the input capacitances because uh there is no pmos you know the the the signals now no longer need to go to the pmos so if i would make a inverter a dynamic inverter the pmos would have a clock on it there would be one n mass with a clock on it and then there will be the other end mass so the effective logical effort of this dynamic inverter would be can you quickly tell me hello so one third one third so wait a minute i seem to have lost control over my powerpoint slideshow why one third just just uh correct me two for the device two for the input gate and two for the clock so what is the total load that the input gate is seeing now two minutes two n so what what do we do then what is the uh uh what is this thing then the logical effort is two-thirds well logical effort is two by three hannah so do we still divide by the static yeah we can divide by the static uh like that is the reference for us as of now is it not so enough yes so how it has become two by three can please explain that again what is the input load of a regular inverter it's a three and what is the input load of this inverter that we talked about so we have a nmos in between that will be of size one why someone one he wanna say you know we have a footer two so uh so if you look at it just give me a moment your system would look like this am i right yes converter so the logical effort is two by three okay fine yes sir okay so then what do we do if we say that this is the kind of logical effort that we have uh what no logical efforts are what other constraints do you see would be happening with this kind of a dynamic gate now your circuit designers what kind of things would you see in the dynamic gate now so i mean i i can see that we cannot use like cascades like stages in stage kind stuff here like dynamic interesting why do you say so so because we have that constraint now because that input can go from only zero to one and suppose in we have cascaded it so if that is going the one is going there so in that for the subsequent state it will disrupt that the same kind of uh problem we will face that we didn't want to face with this same kind of problem so i mean like uh if we go if we have inputs other than going from 0 to 1 then we see that if the capacitor discharge then we don't have any option it will and that logic then will basically we will get different kind of uh we will get basically wrong outputs basically a dynamic then always have one to zero transit a transition at output right yes because at the end of the cycle you have to charge it to one well and uh so if the output has to transition it will always be from 1 to 0 there is no other transition possible and it was already 1 it can only go to 0 now or it will remain as 1. when it remains as 1 what do we say it is floating when it remains as one we say that it is floating are you with me because the pmos is off in the evaluation phase ck equal to 1 so pmos is off and we say it is floating i know this this p mass on which ck goes will be off friends i want feedback yes sir yes yes sir okay so uh once we look into this aspect then then we say that let me show my slides again just give me a moment so then we come to other properties of dynamic gates where we say that overall power dissipation is higher we do not want glitching to happen and we already said higher transition probabilities and clock has very high load are you able to see this but in a static cmos logic style there is hardly any load on clock lock only goes to the flip flops whereas over here clock goes to every combination of gate so the load on clock is very high and we know that for clock alpha is equal to activity factor is equal to 1 1 so that is another reason why overall power of a dynamic logic system is very very high one is that there is any all additional toggling on the inputs also higher transition probabilities but extra load on clock is also there then uh the pull down network starts to work as soon as the input signals exceed vtn so uh you know the transition level v i m and v h are equal vtn as soon as uh the input touches vtn you you now know that okay my my uh output is starting to discharge so there is a noise of more than vtn your output starts to get corrupted so we talked about low noise martin already pre-charged okay we already know so one other important issue so we talked about the floating floating output so what does why is that an issue that is an issue because see there is this diode leakage over here due to this what happens is that you wanted the output to remain one but it is floating due to this leakage this output will discharge yes and this then needs to be restored there is no way to restore this so what you need to do what you need to do otherwise is you need to give the next clock pulse so clock goes to zero then again it recharges back so you need to give this refresh kind of a pulse over and over again this also leads to extra power consumption so yes so i mean like we can say that we can also do we can also like reduce this period for this this discharging is happening then also we can limit that then yeah but it is so okay how is the clock period of a pipeline or or any logic uh determined it is based on that overall evaluation time of that combinational block now yes sir so if you need some period then you need that period are you able to see this that is constrained it will depend upon the critical input as well right uh the input which is most delayed uh yes i know so there will be lots of signals which are coming to your combinational logic and the last one and how much time it takes to evaluate that one that will finally determine how much you need so how do we correct the char the charge leakage problem by using something very similar to what we call as level restorer in the transmission gate or power transistor logic we call it a keeper over here okay this transistor that we put as a half latch back there is called keeper and now what you get is you get out bar at the output are you able to see this oh so actually this keeper here will only prevent the charge from the cl to prevent the cl charge yes sir so i mean in effect it is preventing the charge from taking from that load basically or restoring that mass does not leak from the capacitor man because now it will be from the directly from the vdd that starts does not leak from a capacitor charge leaks from a and b the transistors are that have a and b connected to their gates yeah so now uh so but ineffectively the power that was lost due to leakage that will lose but now the source is different basically yeah yeah so leakage you cannot reduce you're not reducing leakage just saying that the impact of leakage on the gate and its reliability has been mitigated okay okay rajneesh you have a question sir can you move back to one slideshow yes but then there are there's a stack effect also coming now ck is also zero see when this this device is fully on then anyway there is something that will provide charge to this node i don't have a problem now yes whatever leakage happens that that it will follow this path not this path okay are you able to see that yes okay so anything else so this inverter that i used would be static this inverter that i used yeah this will be static [Laughter] yes otherwise it becomes tricky it will not you cannot really cascade it like this uh sir that out bar is meant only for keepers if i want to transfer the output to next stage i will be using the out the on one on the cl right no not necessary in fact we use the out so uh as we as we talk about cascading gates so there is a complexity in cascading the gate someone pointed that thing out we will talk about it in a little so as we will talk about it you will realize that we cannot have a gate uh or we cannot have input transitions going from one to zero in a dynamic gate see we said only one transition is accepted what is also important to realize is that that transition has to be a rising transition it cannot be a falling transition are you able to see this yes so if it has to be a rising transition then the output has to be inverted from whatever you got from the dynamic gate so actually you will use out bar at all the places where you need to use this the output of this combinational gate okay sir yes sir so uh the inverter which i am placing after my uh position of my load circuit that should be sized according to my keeper right so uh or am i thinking of it output load that should be sized according to the load that you want to put on this so but the output of my inverter is connected to my keeper and i should make sure that my keeper works fine whenever my output the main output is uh going down so in this sense i think my keeper should be uh sorry my inverter should be sized according to the keeper yes it has to be sized according to the keeper and also on the load that you put on out bar that is what i am saying okay the load that you put on out bar will be much much larger than this keeper this keeper is going to be very small just like we thought of talked about level restorer in the ptl this keeper has to be very small so that it does not fight back the input transitions okay sir sir and one more small question sir so sir in project we are supposed to place our load at this position only input before the inverter position 25 m2 farad which we were talking in the domino logic yeah i just answered this question now not necessary in fact i don't ask exactly this question i said no you will have to put it on the output of the inverter okay if you have static gate following it then it can be different but if we have dynamic gates following it it has to be an out bar okay okay so uh okay sir understood thank you okay now sir this level restorer you said that this livery store has to be small but we are keeping it so that it can reach uh it can restore the level of cl but if it is small then you can have higher only leakage so it's only leaking the leakage currents are much smaller than on current so that not yes sir so you need a very small keeper okay so so even small keeper will restore the charge even if it has a high resistance yeah because this keeper will be fully on see the keeper is on output is expected to be zero out bar is expected to be zero so the keeper is fully on pmos is in saturation region no yes okay so saturation current of the pmos versus off current of the nmos so keeper can be fairly small it will extend depend on the size it's a saturation current yes but you will see use if you have if you're working on the project with the dynamic gate you will see the skipper will actually be very very small not only will the width be 0.135 you will also keep length much larger than 0.6 106. okay okay and so one more thing is that in all these restorer circuits we are actually creating a feedback so wouldn't wouldn't that feedback i mean how will we ensure that this feedback is that we actually get out of this feedback by keeping this keeper and level restore is very small that's the purpose if we keep these small then even uh even the regular strength and mosque will be able to fight partner okay yeah that's the primary purpose so see the functionality is only to recover the leakage charge so you don't need much current anyways then another constraint is you do not want it to fight back the forward paths yes sir so you keep it small both the constraints lead to you lead you to keeping this keeper very very small as small as possible okay okay okay yes sir uh raghav sir with this keeper you said that earlier in the dynamic center it is a non-ratio like logic so it to maintain that then also like we have to maintain the keeper like to be like zero point one three five we cannot increase from that keeper is as as mother also mentioned keeper as a feedback as soon as you have feedback ratio logics comes in again yes sir yes sir so until there was this until there was there's no keeper there the everything was fully logical as soon as you have this keeper a sizing constraint comes in the keeper has to be as small as possible so but you said that legal we can also increase the velocity is the length like to maintain that yeah okay because other if you cannot reduce the width less than 0.135 in your technology and you want to still make it weaker the easiest way is to increase the length okay so but like my point first i understand that we had to keep it to the minimum side but exactly what exactly will be that uh sweet spot like how do i know about that okay i cannot get the liquid of your device okay of your device at ff125 okay you should do it at fs fast enough slow pmos at fs 125 highest voltage uh the keeper should be able to because pmos is now slow the pmos should still the pmos keeper should still be able to compensate for the charge loss through the inverses which are fast temperature is also high so leakage is high i know so why shouldn't i prefer the ff 125.32 and ss and you will make the keeper also fast it will anyway be able to offer more current okay right yes for the worst case sizing you have to test a tab you have to size the keeper at fast n mass slope mass and at high temperatures and at high voltage the leakage is maximum and at high voltages at higher temperatures the drive strength of the pmos will also reduce yes so that is the pace so you will size the keeper yes

there is very less noise immunity okay for a particular uh within a single cycle of the clock the inputs can be changed at most once um so the inputs can can change only at most once input can go from zero to one only once if it if there is a glitch then i have a problem okay what else to charge and discharge this the power consumption is high so activity factor is very high so yes activity effect is also very that's something different but yeah activity factor is very high because in in terms of uh when you compare it with a static date even if the even if the inputs have not toggled a static gate would not consume any power but a dynamic gate will always consume power you know because at the end of every evaluation phase there is a precharge phase and in that recharge phase whatever capacitances you had discharged would get recharged all over again what else so we also saw that in dynamic gates the total number of transistors would be something like n plus 2 versus 2 n for the static cmos you're able to see this n plus two the plus two things yes sir the header clock the the pmos with the header clock and the n mass with the footer clock then the good thing about this is so we have lesser number of transistors but much much better situation than let us say ptl or pseudo and mass because the outputs are fulfilling outputs are full string the output is either full vdd and when it has to be zero it will be taken to full ground so outputs are full swing and because outputs are full swing and the nmr stack or pmos stack will is not you know there is no race condition or fight back between the two nmos and pmos traps like in uh pseudo nmos kind of a case the sizing does not really affect the logic levels the sizing affects the delays but it does not affect the logic levels and what also has happened we discussed this also in the last class we've reduced the capacitance with all capacitances have they reduced input all the pmos the most one we reduce the input capacitances because uh there is no pmos you know the the the signals now no longer need to go to the pmos so if i would make a inverter a dynamic inverter the pmos would have a clock on it there would be one n mass with a clock on it and then there will be the other end mass so the effective logical effort of this dynamic inverter would be can you quickly tell me hello so one third one third so wait a minute i seem to have lost control over my powerpoint slideshow why one third just just uh correct me two for the device two for the input gate and two for the clock so what is the total load that the input gate is seeing now two minutes two n so what what do we do then what is the uh uh what is this thing then the logical effort is two-thirds well logical effort is two by three hannah so do we still divide by the static yeah we can divide by the static uh like that is the reference for us as of now is it not so enough yes so how it has become two by three can please explain that again what is the input load of a regular inverter it's a three and what is the input load of this inverter that we talked about so we have a nmos in between that will be of size one why someone one he wanna say you know we have a footer two so uh so if you look at it just give me a moment your system would look like this am i right yes converter so the logical effort is two by three okay fine yes sir okay so then what do we do if we say that this is the kind of logical effort that we have uh what no logical efforts are what other constraints do you see would be happening with this kind of a dynamic gate now your circuit designers what kind of things would you see in the dynamic gate now so i mean i i can see that we cannot use like cascades like stages in stage kind stuff here like dynamic interesting why do you say so so because we have that constraint now because that input can go from only zero to one and suppose in we have cascaded it so if that is going the one is going there so in that for the subsequent state it will disrupt that the same kind of uh problem we will face that we didn't want to face with this same kind of problem so i mean like uh if we go if we have inputs other than going from 0 to 1 then we see that if the capacitor discharge then we don't have any option it will and that logic then will basically we will get different kind of uh we will get basically wrong outputs basically a dynamic then always have one to zero transit a transition at output right yes because at the end of the cycle you have to charge it to one well and uh so if the output has to transition it will always be from 1 to 0 there is no other transition possible and it was already 1 it can only go to 0 now or it will remain as 1. when it remains as 1 what do we say it is floating when it remains as one we say that it is floating are you with me because the pmos is off in the evaluation phase ck equal to 1 so pmos is off and we say it is floating i know this this p mass on which ck goes will be off friends i want feedback yes sir yes yes sir okay so uh once we look into this aspect then then we say that let me show my slides again just give me a moment so then we come to other properties of dynamic gates where we say that overall power dissipation is higher we do not want glitching to happen and we already said higher transition probabilities and clock has very high load are you able to see this but in a static cmos logic style there is hardly any load on clock lock only goes to the flip flops whereas over here clock goes to every combination of gate so the load on clock is very high and we know that for clock alpha is equal to activity factor is equal to 1 1 so that is another reason why overall power of a dynamic logic system is very very high one is that there is any all additional toggling on the inputs also higher transition probabilities but extra load on clock is also there then uh the pull down network starts to work as soon as the input signals exceed vtn so uh you know the transition level v i m and v h are equal vtn as soon as uh the input touches vtn you you now know that okay my my uh output is starting to discharge so there is a noise of more than vtn your output starts to get corrupted so we talked about low noise martin already pre-charged okay we already know so one other important issue so we talked about the floating floating output so what does why is that an issue that is an issue because see there is this diode leakage over here due to this what happens is that you wanted the output to remain one but it is floating due to this leakage this output will discharge yes and this then needs to be restored there is no way to restore this so what you need to do what you need to do otherwise is you need to give the next clock pulse so clock goes to zero then again it recharges back so you need to give this refresh kind of a pulse over and over again this also leads to extra power consumption so yes so i mean like we can say that we can also do we can also like reduce this period for this this discharging is happening then also we can limit that then yeah but it is so okay how is the clock period of a pipeline or or any logic uh determined it is based on that overall evaluation time of that combinational block now yes sir so if you need some period then you need that period are you able to see this that is constrained it will depend upon the critical input as well right uh the input which is most delayed uh yes i know so there will be lots of signals which are coming to your combinational logic and the last one and how much time it takes to evaluate that one that will finally determine how much you need so how do we correct the char the charge leakage problem by using something very similar to what we call as level restorer in the transmission gate or power transistor logic we call it a keeper over here okay this transistor that we put as a half latch back there is called keeper and now what you get is you get out bar at the output are you able to see this oh so actually this keeper here will only prevent the charge from the cl to prevent the cl charge yes sir so i mean in effect it is preventing the charge from taking from that load basically or restoring that mass does not leak from the capacitor man because now it will be from the directly from the vdd that starts does not leak from a capacitor charge leaks from a and b the transistors are that have a and b connected to their gates yeah so now uh so but ineffectively the power that was lost due to leakage that will lose but now the source is different basically yeah yeah so leakage you cannot reduce you're not reducing leakage just saying that the impact of leakage on the gate and its reliability has been mitigated okay okay rajneesh you have a question sir can you move back to one slideshow yes but then there are there's a stack effect also coming now ck is also zero see when this this device is fully on then anyway there is something that will provide charge to this node i don't have a problem now yes whatever leakage happens that that it will follow this path not this path okay are you able to see that yes okay so anything else so this inverter that i used would be static this inverter that i used yeah this will be static [Laughter] yes otherwise it becomes tricky it will not you cannot really cascade it like this uh sir that out bar is meant only for keepers if i want to transfer the output to next stage i will be using the out the on one on the cl right no not necessary in fact we use the out so uh as we as we talk about cascading gates so there is a complexity in cascading the gate someone pointed that thing out we will talk about it in a little so as we will talk about it you will realize that we cannot have a gate uh or we cannot have input transitions going from one to zero in a dynamic gate see we said only one transition is accepted what is also important to realize is that that transition has to be a rising transition it cannot be a falling transition are you able to see this yes so if it has to be a rising transition then the output has to be inverted from whatever you got from the dynamic gate so actually you will use out bar at all the places where you need to use this the output of this combinational gate okay sir yes sir so uh the inverter which i am placing after my uh position of my load circuit that should be sized according to my keeper right so uh or am i thinking of it output load that should be sized according to the load that you want to put on this so but the output of my inverter is connected to my keeper and i should make sure that my keeper works fine whenever my output the main output is uh going down so in this sense i think my keeper should be uh sorry my inverter should be sized according to the keeper yes it has to be sized according to the keeper and also on the load that you put on out bar that is what i am saying okay the load that you put on out bar will be much much larger than this keeper this keeper is going to be very small just like we thought of talked about level restorer in the ptl this keeper has to be very small so that it does not fight back the input transitions okay sir sir and one more small question sir so sir in project we are supposed to place our load at this position only input before the inverter position 25 m2 farad which we were talking in the domino logic yeah i just answered this question now not necessary in fact i don't ask exactly this question i said no you will have to put it on the output of the inverter okay if you have static gate following it then it can be different but if we have dynamic gates following it it has to be an out bar okay okay so uh okay sir understood thank you okay now sir this level restorer you said that this livery store has to be small but we are keeping it so that it can reach uh it can restore the level of cl but if it is small then you can have higher only leakage so it's only leaking the leakage currents are much smaller than on current so that not yes sir so you need a very small keeper okay so so even small keeper will restore the charge even if it has a high resistance yeah because this keeper will be fully on see the keeper is on output is expected to be zero out bar is expected to be zero so the keeper is fully on pmos is in saturation region no yes okay so saturation current of the pmos versus off current of the nmos so keeper can be fairly small it will extend depend on the size it's a saturation current yes but you will see use if you have if you're working on the project with the dynamic gate you will see the skipper will actually be very very small not only will the width be 0.135 you will also keep length much larger than 0.6 106. okay okay and so one more thing is that in all these restorer circuits we are actually creating a feedback so wouldn't wouldn't that feedback i mean how will we ensure that this feedback is that we actually get out of this feedback by keeping this keeper and level restore is very small that's the purpose if we keep these small then even uh even the regular strength and mosque will be able to fight partner okay yeah that's the primary purpose so see the functionality is only to recover the leakage charge so you don't need much current anyways then another constraint is you do not want it to fight back the forward paths yes sir so you keep it small both the constraints lead to you lead you to keeping this keeper very very small as small as possible okay okay okay yes sir uh raghav sir with this keeper you said that earlier in the dynamic center it is a non-ratio like logic so it to maintain that then also like we have to maintain the keeper like to be like zero point one three five we cannot increase from that keeper is as as mother also mentioned keeper as a feedback as soon as you have feedback ratio logics comes in again yes sir yes sir so until there was this until there was there's no keeper there the everything was fully logical as soon as you have this keeper a sizing constraint comes in the keeper has to be as small as possible so but you said that legal we can also increase the velocity is the length like to maintain that yeah okay because other if you cannot reduce the width less than 0.135 in your technology and you want to still make it weaker the easiest way is to increase the length okay so but like my point first i understand that we had to keep it to the minimum side but exactly what exactly will be that uh sweet spot like how do i know about that okay i cannot get the liquid of your device okay of your device at ff125 okay you should do it at fs fast enough slow pmos at fs 125 highest voltage uh the keeper should be able to because pmos is now slow the pmos should still the pmos keeper should still be able to compensate for the charge loss through the inverses which are fast temperature is also high so leakage is high i know so why shouldn't i prefer the ff 125.32 and ss and you will make the keeper also fast it will anyway be able to offer more current okay right yes for the worst case sizing you have to test a tab you have to size the keeper at fast n mass slope mass and at high temperatures and at high voltage the leakage is maximum and at high voltages at higher temperatures the drive strength of the pmos will also reduce yes so that is the pace so you will size the keeper yes sir"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,1s96L4B1Nrk,um sir in the layout of uh domino logic if i am using a standard cell template then i am able to see that if i am using four to five uh input uh a y then i have seven to it n was and only three b mos there i'll see that recording so what we do is at the edges we keep the envelopes to be as much as we wanted hannah so we make our t masses here you make the output p masses here all that you do then you take this up and then what you do is you put your n masses here so now you have more space for your end losses okay but this minimum width of envelope has to be maintained this minimum width of n well has to be maintained and uh this has to be maintained so ab drc sorry maintain kirk you can always do this okay thank you okay uh sir i just wanted to confirm that only the rising transition accepted because uh when the clock is high that would only be yeah that would only be the transition which would help the output to discharge and there is nothing and other no special reason for other other changes you tell me if the clock is high that is when the evaluation phase is on yes let us say a and b were initially one and you say only one transition is allowed now b goes to zero after some time after clock has come b goes to 0 after some time and you say oh this is only one transition allow this will it work no that is why only one transition and that to a rising transition yes exactly okay okay thanks sir so one small question regarding the c load thing says this c load should be attached after one more inverter after outbound right because uh what the cl is in their case they've put the c load there but if you have to so if you have to cascade uh so after this dynamic gate the dynamic nand gate if you were to use static gates then all that c load can come on this place where they have put this here however if it has to be dynamic gates then you will just see raw vm battery at a debunk also has exactly the same thing that you only accept zero to one rising transitions so you have to have this inverter in place without this inverter you cannot connect the next dynamic gate stage because if you connect the dynamic gate stage over here let us say let us say you put another dynamic gate stage over here what will happen so this is one clock comes this this one would discharge now this was already one but over here also a and b were one so they also discharge now this goes to zero what will you do now okay so the next pdn network could be off but it is already discharged the capacitance over here no yes and nothing we could do to uh now you lost this information now this is not usable therefore what we do is we instead modify the logic in such a way that it will put put out bar at your gate okay yes sir cl so one more small question is that suppose we are making we are suppose not cascading and only making one aoi only complex state then to represent the correct output we need to put an inverter right because which trip are we talking about which chip are we talking about can there be a list which has only one gate just give me a moment okay yeah i'm sorry so see you cannot really make just one static gate somewhere can you no sir i know so you will always have more designs some you cannot have a chip with only one gate so let's not talk of a hypothetical situation when there are gates cascaded one after the other if the gate cascaded after a dynamic gate is a dynamic gate then that gate has to come after this inverter it cannot come before the inverter if it comes then we have to design that gate in a different manner we will just see that also so let's just hold these questions of cascading gates for a little while is that okay we'll cover that part in just a little bit please sir i have a general question sir so my clock will be running all over the uh all over my layout so uh my doubt was that so i should make sure that my clock should be a lcm of these both gate but both inputs a and b for suppose in this lcm least common multiple of period of both inputs so that i can get all my outs a and b are not a and b are not clocks they do not have a period they are they are just like uh let us say uh i am i'm adding two numbers so there could be 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 anything that could be it is not a clock so what do you mean by period of a and b okay that actually that was my doubt sir actually as my a and b signals are not sure uh then uh how am i supposed to know that my clock which i give to this system uh should make sure that i should be uh i should be capable of doing every method for a and b there are four combinations zero zero zero one one zero and one one i should be capable of doing all this all these combinations in that case uh now if i if i look into the system then for for this zero zero zero one one zero one one kind of thing uh i'll have some specific value specific time period of a and time period of b uh if i if i give it uh first suppose then uh my clock in this condition should be the lcm of this both time periods uh in in a specific condition then but do you have a time period for a non non uh recurring signal no sir this was made out i i got it clarified just now okay there's no time period of a and b there is a timing constraint between a and b and clock that a and b should be settled before clock arrives that timing constraint you can't talk about but time period is there's nothing like a time period for a and b okay okay sir thank you okay so you want that if the a and b have to be one then they should arrive some sometime before block arrives sir uh the clock frequency here must be of one particular one it should not vary with if we are doing some different operation so if the clock frequency is varying denser [Music] means our this time period must be constant measure for a particular sizing of circuits yeah for a particular processor for a particular design you will have you will arrive at some clock frequency at which you will operate yes okay i know so all the combinational gates will will get the same clock whether it is a nand gate or a y or whatever it is so another problem that happens we just now looked at the leakage problem now consider this case clk is already one let us say and now a goes to one b remains at zero what happens c c l will charge c a there will be charge redistribution between cl and ca and what does this do to cl so its logic level basically gets speakers and there is no way to recharge it back yes sir so what do you do then again you put level resource now in this particular case it does not look very complex but look at this gate there is some cl which is 50 central farads and there are this internal capacitances also so if you really end up using the 50 cent of farad capacitor to distrib and distributed starch all over the place you may actually come to as low a value as vdd by 2 are you able to see this yes yes sir so what do you do what can you do over here recharge the internal nodes sorry so uh yes you will put some precharge somewhere so just like the level restorer the keeper that we had put there we would put some keepers over here also so we will actually end up putting keepers at suppose if you have this so you can always you know find out how the charge distribution would happen this this is very basic you can find this out i can assume that you can find this out friends server is it not increasing the area of our circuit like if we are putting keepers yeah it is so uh and keepers usually we put an inverter which is of a larger size because look at look at this complex kit that we just saw this was so this is a four input aoi kind of a gate huh now area is increasing yes because you put one keeper let us say you you end up putting keepers at at all these big capacitances you will put one keeper over here one keeper over here whatever okay so you put some but these are very small p masses now if for this if for this nmos pull down network you have to make a pull up network what was the area that you were looking into okay so i i got confused because the keepers i'm not only about the area but i'm seeing that the clock is also getting we have to provide more power clock power and then also the parasitics also is increasing at the point we are providing the keepers right there so i mean clock has to drive then more kind of uh devices right because uh the pmos that would be using for the keeper that will be also driven by the clock so if we add more and more keepers need not be that can be driven by this output also now can be clocked even the output because you finally you wanted this to be if this was one and you had a you want to maintain it as one you do not want to disagree you just use it like that okay yes so we can [Music] combine recharge will happen from the clock precast will happen from mp over here right so another third transistor for keypad yeah a keeper is to be added yes okay okay sir will be uh sir will we add a single keeper for single node or one keeper can take care of many nodes you tell me how many source and drain does one keeper have said if i attach one source too many so it means you're shorting all those notes they become one note then oh sorry yes see look at it like this yes it appears to be inefficient but it is much much faster yes yes at cost of increasing yes no not increased area area as we just discussed is also lesser keepers are very small the pmos is that you will need to put with this pulldown network will be very large comparatively okay i know sir even if my output capacitance charge has been discharged by the parasitics in between uh even uh but i have my keeper above for my output capacitance so uh is this keeper is it not sufficient to drive my output to vdd back again uh depends vaishnav just as we looked in that example if the output has gone to vdd by two then the inverter must have also gone too high so keeper would have turned off okay so in that case my keeper is inefficient to get back that is where you will then need the clocks or you will need keepers also in those internal places and not just on the top okay okay okay so that there is minimal charge sharing okay yeah uh raghav uh yes sir sir like as rajneesh asked that we can get some uh positive thing with the advantage with the tph pizza i think that theoretically tpl is zero right i mean because the rising thing that the clock is taking care of the p charge phase is taking care of that the reset phase no no there is a reset phase recharge time we said the reset time would reduce yes fine okay and so like here you would you talking like with the extra keeper that is hacking we don't necessarily need to connect it with the clock we can connect it directly with the output like inverter right okay it thank you what is the problem with when we do that so we can do that yes in specific cases we can't do that but what is the problem when will we not be able to do that okay uh currently out yeah output voltage which we have we are dead sorting it with the node which is in between a and b why my keeper is connected to output however and this same same position is being connected in between of my a and b no so we said we have to add an extra keeper now yes so okay so the here can i just add one keeper and charge all the nodes with that and we realize no that is not possible okay so this keeper which you are showing is only for an internal node in this diagram you see this has clock going this has clock going to it the one on the output the keeper that i put here for that we had this inverted output going there now my question is that inverted output could also go to some of these keepers what will be the problem or how do you avoid how to avoid that problem if you connect this out bar like what do you do can you always do it or do you always need clock so clock is needed because else the pull the footer would be on and there would be a shot between vdd and ground at some places yes at some places it could happen that out is let us say sometimes it could happen that let us say in this particular case for example uh let us say a was 0 b was 1 now what happens as soon as clock goes to 1 this node is expected to discharge but a is 0 so a will not let the out node to disarch so if i had this inverter coming and then connecting what would happen this remains one this goes to zero so there is a direct path from vdg to ground so we can use output also for such intermediate keepers but you have to be extremely careful that the connectivity is such that there is no direct path if you want to play very very safe use the clock clock load would increase and uh yeah keepers are much smaller than these three charge transistors but but even then clock load would increase sir one small thing just can i uh ask this is the last class someone asks that footer can we place over a or b or not same thing could occur here also uh because clock will would be changing from one to zero and therefore zero to one so uh direct short path could exist again here if we place footer above a and b so uh the switching leakage would increase right i mean switching current would increase right you could place footer above dnb right because uh sir a direct longer direct path would exist where both the footer and free charge would be on at the same time uh during the clock transiting period why let us say this is how i put it and then i put a and b over here now where is this extra current going there's nothing supposed to be a and b is zero okay then nothing no if a and b were one then anyway there were three even then in this case also three devices were one so they were expected to discharge out okay you know okay sorry i know so why do we still keep the ck on the bottom we could put ck on up there also but why do we still keep it on the bottom so maybe due to that we want to like uh keep the clock signals away from uh internal metal or internal interconnects or that because that can lead to like some kind of capacitive effect coupling so it essentially becomes an inverter and in in water layout or making we saw whenever the inverter switches there is some kink at the uh output that we observed so some noise could be introduced i think okay something else we just decided is the footer larger than other internal can be and that doesn't matter that is not where the answer is we discussed about this you know in the static gates we talked about inputs coming late should be closer to the output so over here in the evaluation phase the output will discharge when a and b will go to one so what is coming after c has gone to one a and b hello so therefore we need the c k to be on the bottom so that your output still comes fast rather this yes but like one was the input ordering but uh could that be also reason that uh because clock activity is very high so in between we have like different kind of interconnects running through that and if it is other you know let us forget that even if you do not look at the layout aspects you want stills the ck to be at the bottom because once whenever a and b whichever of them when both of them go to one you want the output to be discharged as quickly as possible yes sir yes that is that is the reason okay if you are always sure that this a and b will arrive before ck arrives it will always be set up then it's a different thing but that's not usually the case you will not be able to ascertain that so now the next problem that we are looking at is uh back gate coupling so we said that you could you could uh couple uh you could couple static dates directly at the output of the dynamic gate without the inverter and then because static gates can take both kind of transition zero to one and one to zero so static gate script will challenge but when you couple a static gate right after the write down out one what can happen yeah so back gate coupling starts to happen now let us say that your out one was something and uh out two or something and all that in goes to 1 from 0 from 0 in goes to 1 out 1 was already 1 what will happen at once out 2 will discharge now yes sir when out two discharges what will happen due to miller coupling out one will also see some discharge happening so this back gate coupling is also an issue that you will have in dynamic gates so even when you are coupling a static gate next to a dynamic gate there could be such challenges that can appear are you able to see this sir yes so when the outpour is getting discharged out one will also see a discharge can you please explain this line duty miller coupling yeah this is the capacitance this is the miller coupling yes sir so out 2 went to zero psn now this coupling capacitance is also between out two and out one okay yes sir okay another problem that we have is clock feed through so dynamic gates when you want to use okay they are very very fast very very high speed but they suffer from lots of these problems there is another problem of clock feed through this is something like what are you talking about we thought that pelican when the clock comes there will be some feed through between clock and the output this is what we discussed you know this this part you remember yes sir you discussed this earlier so this is also a problem because unnecessarily your clock your output is going up and low and all that we don't want that also so and and these cannot be avoided and there are other problems also capacitive coupling as we know that this node is floating this output node will be floating when ck is equal to one so any crosstalk that will lead to noise and injection of a charge injection over here substrate coupling any any any noise on the substrate over here when the output is floating again that will couple on to the output so uh supply noise so many things linked to dynamic gates but even then you will see they are used fairly much more often than pass transistor logic and transmission gate logic they're used much more often than those two places why because they're very high speed very very high speed power is higher but speed is also very high which is what people love yes but theoretically if i say i think you see that but pseudo nmos would be even faster should be than this dynamic right so it almost cannot go to zero no yeah that is the challenge so you don't want that anna rajneesh sir can you move to the clock feed through slide voltage reliability becomes an issue okay so sorry we will write that if we did increase the gate reliability decreases yeah at higher variety the gate is gate areas faster so the gate reliability degrades yes okay okay i know yes yes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s96L4B1Nrk,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s96L4B1Nrk

no sir i know so you will always have more designs some you cannot have a chip with only one gate so let's not talk of a hypothetical situation when there are gates cascaded one after the other if the gate cascaded after a dynamic gate is a dynamic gate then that gate has to come after this inverter it cannot come before the inverter if it comes then we have to design that gate in a different manner we will just see that also so let's just hold these questions of cascading gates for a little while is that okay we'll cover that part in just a little bit please sir i have a general question sir so my clock will be running all over the uh all over my layout so uh my doubt was that so i should make sure that my clock should be a lcm of these both gate but both inputs a and b for suppose in this lcm least common multiple of period of both inputs so that i can get all my outs a and b are not a and b are not clocks they do not have a period they are they are just like uh let us say uh i am i'm adding two numbers so there could be 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 anything that could be it is not a clock so what do you mean by period of a and b okay that actually that was my doubt sir actually as my a and b signals are not sure uh then uh how am i supposed to know that my clock which i give to this system uh should make sure that i should be uh i should be capable of doing every method for a and b there are four combinations zero zero zero one one zero and one one i should be capable of doing all this all these combinations in that case uh now if i if i look into the system then for for this zero zero zero one one zero one one kind of thing uh i'll have some specific value specific time period of a and time period of b uh if i if i give it uh first suppose then uh my clock in this condition should be the lcm of this both time periods uh in in a specific condition then but do you have a time period for a non non uh recurring signal no sir this was made out i i got it clarified just now okay there's no time period of a and b there is a timing constraint between a and b and clock that a and b should be settled before clock arrives that timing constraint you can't talk about but time period is there's nothing like a time period for a and b okay okay sir thank you okay so you want that if the a and b have to be one then they should arrive some sometime before block arrives sir uh the clock frequency here must be of one particular one it should not vary with if we are doing some different operation so if the clock frequency is varying denser [Music] means our this time period must be constant measure for a particular sizing of circuits yeah for a particular processor for a particular design you will have you will arrive at some clock frequency at which you will operate yes okay i know so all the combinational gates will will get the same clock whether it is a nand gate or a y or whatever it is so another problem that happens we just now looked at the leakage problem now consider this case clk is already one let us say and now a goes to one b remains at zero what happens c c l will charge c a there will be charge redistribution between cl and ca and what does this do to cl so its logic level basically gets speakers and there is no way to recharge it back yes sir so what do you do then again you put level resource now in this particular case it does not look very complex but look at this gate there is some cl which is 50 central farads and there are this internal capacitances also so if you really end up using the 50 cent of farad capacitor to distrib and distributed starch all over the place you may actually come to as low a value as vdd by 2 are you able to see this yes yes sir so what do you do what can you do over here recharge the internal nodes sorry so uh yes you will put some precharge somewhere so just like the level restorer the keeper that we had put there we would put some keepers over here also so we will actually end up putting keepers at suppose if you have this so you can always you know find out how the charge distribution would happen this this is very basic you can find this out i can assume that you can find this out friends server is it not increasing the area of our circuit like if we are putting keepers yeah it is so uh and keepers usually we put an inverter which is of a larger size because look at look at this complex kit that we just saw this was so this is a four input aoi kind of a gate huh now area is increasing yes because you put one keeper let us say you you end up putting keepers at at all these big capacitances you will put one keeper over here one keeper over here whatever okay so you put some but these are very small p masses now if for this if for this nmos pull down network you have to make a pull up network what was the area that you were looking into okay so i i got confused because the keepers i'm not only about the area but i'm seeing that the clock is also getting we have to provide more power clock power and then also the parasitics also is increasing at the point we are providing the keepers right there so i mean clock has to drive then more kind of uh devices right because uh the pmos that would be using for the keeper that will be also driven by the clock so if we add more and more keepers need not be that can be driven by this output also now can be clocked even the output because you finally you wanted this to be if this was one and you had a you want to maintain it as one you do not want to disagree you just use it like that okay yes so we can [Music] combine recharge will happen from the clock precast will happen from mp over here right so another third transistor for keypad yeah a keeper is to be added yes okay okay sir will be uh sir will we add a single keeper for single node or one keeper can take care of many nodes you tell me how many source and drain does one keeper have said if i attach one source too many so it means you're shorting all those notes they become one note then oh sorry yes see look at it like this yes it appears to be inefficient but it is much much faster yes yes at cost of increasing yes no not increased area area as we just discussed is also lesser keepers are very small the pmos is that you will need to put with this pulldown network will be very large comparatively okay i know sir even if my output capacitance charge has been discharged by the parasitics in between uh even uh but i have my keeper above for my output capacitance so uh is this keeper is it not sufficient to drive my output to vdd back again uh depends vaishnav just as we looked in that example if the output has gone to vdd by two then the inverter must have also gone too high so keeper would have turned off okay so in that case my keeper is inefficient to get back that is where you will then need the clocks or you will need keepers also in those internal places and not just on the top okay okay okay so that there is minimal charge sharing okay yeah uh raghav uh yes sir sir like as rajneesh asked that we can get some uh positive thing with the advantage with the tph pizza i think that theoretically tpl is zero right i mean because the rising thing that the clock is taking care of the p charge phase is taking care of that the reset phase no no there is a reset phase recharge time we said the reset time would reduce yes fine okay and so like here you would you talking like with the extra keeper that is hacking we don't necessarily need to connect it with the clock we can connect it directly with the output like inverter right okay it thank you what is the problem with when we do that so we can do that yes in specific cases we can't do that but what is the problem when will we not be able to do that okay uh currently out yeah output voltage which we have we are dead sorting it with the node which is in between a and b why my keeper is connected to output however and this same same position is being connected in between of my a and b no so we said we have to add an extra keeper now yes so okay so the here can i just add one keeper and charge all the nodes with that and we realize no that is not possible okay so this keeper which you are showing is only for an internal node in this diagram you see this has clock going this has clock going to it the one on the output the keeper that i put here for that we had this inverted output going there now my question is that inverted output could also go to some of these keepers what will be the problem or how do you avoid how to avoid that problem if you connect this out bar like what do you do can you always do it or do you always need clock so clock is needed because else the pull the footer would be on and there would be a shot between vdd and ground at some places yes at some places it could happen that out is let us say sometimes it could happen that let us say in this particular case for example uh let us say a was 0 b was 1 now what happens as soon as clock goes to 1 this node is expected to discharge but a is 0 so a will not let the out node to disarch so if i had this inverter coming and then connecting what would happen this remains one this goes to zero so there is a direct path from vdg to ground so we can use output also for such intermediate keepers but you have to be extremely careful that the connectivity is such that there is no direct path if you want to play very very safe use the clock clock load would increase and uh yeah keepers are much smaller than these three charge transistors but but even then clock load would increase sir one small thing just can i uh ask this is the last class someone asks that footer can we place over a or b or not same thing could occur here also uh because clock will would be changing from one to zero and therefore zero to one so uh direct short path could exist again here if we place footer above a and b so uh the switching leakage would increase right i mean switching current would increase right you could place footer above dnb right because uh sir a direct longer direct path would exist where both the footer and free charge would be on at the same time uh during the clock transiting period why let us say this is how i put it and then i put a and b over here now where is this extra current going there's nothing supposed to be a and b is zero okay then nothing no if a and b were one then anyway there were three even then in this case also three devices were one so they were expected to discharge out okay you know okay sorry i know so why do we still keep the ck on the bottom we could put ck on up there also but why do we still keep it on the bottom so maybe due to that we want to like uh keep the clock signals away from uh internal metal or internal interconnects or that because that can lead to like some kind of capacitive effect coupling so it essentially becomes an inverter and in in water layout or making we saw whenever the inverter switches there is some kink at the uh output that we observed so some noise could be introduced i think okay something else we just decided is the footer larger than other internal can be and that doesn't matter that is not where the answer is we discussed about this you know in the static gates we talked about inputs coming late should be closer to the output so over here in the evaluation phase the output will discharge when a and b will go to one so what is coming after c has gone to one a and b hello so therefore we need the c k to be on the bottom so that your output still comes fast rather this yes but like one was the input ordering but uh could that be also reason that uh because clock activity is very high so in between we have like different kind of interconnects running through that and if it is other you know let us forget that even if you do not look at the layout aspects you want stills the ck to be at the bottom because once whenever a and b whichever of them when both of them go to one you want the output to be discharged as quickly as possible yes sir yes that is that is the reason okay if you are always sure that this a and b will arrive before ck arrives it will always be set up then it's a different thing but that's not usually the case you will not be able to ascertain that so now the next problem that we are looking at is uh back gate coupling so we said that you could you could uh couple uh you could couple static dates directly at the output of the dynamic gate without the inverter and then because static gates can take both kind of transition zero to one and one to zero so static gate script will challenge but when you couple a static gate right after the write down out one what can happen yeah so back gate coupling starts to happen now let us say that your out one was something and uh out two or something and all that in goes to 1 from 0 from 0 in goes to 1 out 1 was already 1 what will happen at once out 2 will discharge now yes sir when out two discharges what will happen due to miller coupling out one will also see some discharge happening so this back gate coupling is also an issue that you will have in dynamic gates so even when you are coupling a static gate next to a dynamic gate there could be such challenges that can appear are you able to see this sir yes so when the outpour is getting discharged out one will also see a discharge can you please explain this line duty miller coupling yeah this is the capacitance this is the miller coupling yes sir so out 2 went to zero psn now this coupling capacitance is also between out two and out one okay yes sir okay another problem that we have is clock feed through so dynamic gates when you want to use okay they are very very fast very very high speed but they suffer from lots of these problems there is another problem of clock feed through this is something like what are you talking about we thought that pelican when the clock comes there will be some feed through between clock and the output this is what we discussed you know this this part you remember yes sir you discussed this earlier so this is also a problem because unnecessarily your clock your output is going up and low and all that we don't want that also so and and these cannot be avoided and there are other problems also capacitive coupling as we know that this node is floating this output node will be floating when ck is equal to one so any crosstalk that will lead to noise and injection of a charge injection over here substrate coupling any any any noise on the substrate over here when the output is floating again that will couple on to the output so uh supply noise so many things linked to dynamic gates but even then you will see they are used fairly much more often than pass transistor logic and transmission gate logic they're used much more often than those two places why because they're very high speed very very high speed power is higher but speed is also very high which is what people love yes but theoretically if i say i think you see that but pseudo nmos would be even faster should be than this dynamic right so it almost cannot go to zero no yeah that is the challenge so you don't want that anna rajneesh sir can you move to the clock feed through slide voltage reliability becomes an issue okay so sorry we will write that if we did increase the gate reliability decreases yeah at higher variety the gate is gate areas faster so the gate reliability degrades yes okay okay i know yes yes"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,ouihedF07RY,okay so now we formally come to the topic of cascading dynamic gates so we see that this is not this is not the right way to cascade anna what would happen here out transition is from one to zero then i will have some discharge and that will not be refreshed yes so out one goes to zero after ck comes but even before out out one has goes to zero out two has discharged earlier so you cannot really cascade dynamic gate just like this so what do we do we can have other ways to cascade gates so which is like first we already talked about put an inverter in between then what will solve the problem because transitions are now always zero to equal to one zero to one transitions are safe no problems there this is called domino logic why is it called domino you've seen dominoes yes sir the circuit is being evaluated one after the another stage by stage yeah so dominoes are are stacks of cards one false it touches the other one the other one falls the other one falls over and falls and the whole chain activate gets activated uh during the corona times there was this ad you know that you have to break the chain so we are the mask so one person wears a mask that person comes out of this domino chain and the overall chain breaks otherwise everyone gets infected you remember that ad what's up they bought circulatory seen that yes sir so domino this is called domino because until out one goes to one tdn the second period will not evaluate so only after first pdn has evaluated will the second pdn evaluate then the third pd and evaluate then the fourth pdn evaluate that is why it is called as domino logic okay yeah questions so tarun uh hello sir it's more of an open-ended question so as we go more and more towards low power design so shouldn't uh the the dynamic circuits will be like very little use yeah but they're still much more as i said they're still much more often used than ptl and uh pseudo pseudonymous is not used almost anywhere you will still see dynamic circuits used fairly often much often than pseudo nmos and ptl okay so learning all these all the different designs is fine but with so much variety of designs that are possible and how do we even decide what a particular how to probably design a particular thing like in a processor there will be thousands of different components like address multipliers and so many different kinds of things and so many different kinds of constraints if this is fast then this has to be slow and all these things have to be made so how do we even decide on this default so mother the default would be static cmos okay now if you want higher speed than static cmos then you go to dynamic okay if in the static cmos you know that there are places where you could save area by going to ppl and that those those movements are always you know 0 0 0 0 output to be transmitted from one side to the other then you could go to ptl also okay for example now this will be ptl varieties would be in in places like implementing muxes in memories okay so there are some very specific use cases for all these other design styles default is always static cmos and that too whatever is best for your layout all those skewed cmos gates and high skew low q and all those they are also very specifically used in data paths you really want to speed up exactly one or two critical paths otherwise even they are not used even though they are static cmos okay but all these levers you should know as designers because tomorrow when you go and design somewhere you should know that okay if my manager or my customer is asking for much higher speed there is one this additional lever that i have which is domino logic i can try that and you can experiment with it and you can see okay now with domino static cmos i can go to 500 megahertz domino i can go to 800 but with static cmos the power was let us say 2 milliwatts and the domino it is 3.8 i've got much higher speed but power has also increased so let the customer choose okay okay so like in embedded systems like application i will prefer to use static because it consumes lower power and not typically you will only use static mother status is a mainstay that is why it is also taught in second third year okay okay there's being an advanced course you're talking about more advanced things also okay okay yes sir those are not the main step don't confuse it with that they are not the mainstay all this dc vsl and all those so we discussed the cvsr for example is only only used for xor nor combination almost nowhere else the very specific uh ideas and they are being shared so that after you go home and if you come up with you know you you get inspired by these specific games and you can propose something new yourself also okay so okay yeah yes sir sir one confusion that i'm getting over here is uh sir how we are preserving the means uh total means logic actually total input to output logic how do you preserve that in a regular static cmos gate sir my confusion here is suppose we are implementing an sop suppose a b plus c d the first stage would be and gate next stage should be or gate so now here we are press if you are placing an inverter in between so means that no they are there demorgan's theorem you know that now so some kind of bubble pushing need to be made and land and representation something like that yes what's the big deal there that is a simpler part the other challenges that we discussed just now they are the more complex ones they breathe well pushing is so logical it is so simple so suppose you you have given me to design aoi in non-complex form in a uh where individual gates need to be also a dynamic gate so you will not ask me that uh suppose this is a and gate why we implement it using a nand gate we will just simply now input an output right yeah answer one more question here after we create the truth table that's it uh yes a truth table should be preserved input and output and one more thing here is that uh it's a keeper circuit how will how we can place that can we just show in the diagram keep a circuit in the character in the first level okay why why was this question there sir output capacitance increase over there at 0.135 by 0.2 it's a very small keeper so turning on the keeper would be not a problem or challenge anywhere that's and that is why you also design it to be very small huh yes sir you should understand thank you yeah so can we here also prefer that in this inverter can we prefer a high screen water here because we are only interested in the zero you tell me uh what was the if this inverter was not there what was the default state of input coming to this second pdf if this inverter was not there what would be this input's default state in the pre-charge state zero to one clockwise so if it is one then what happens after as soon as clock comes even before this one discharges this one would discharge yes sir we don't want that yes okay yes okay okay okay because inverter changes the default state to zero yes sir okay okay so yeah this is also explained in the animation over here now domino we just discussed why it is domino because only after the first one is evaluated the second one will be evaluated and the third one then the fourth one okay and uh again properties of domino only non-inverted logic can be can be implemented and because it is dynamic gate based and capacitances are reduced there is smaller logical effort this is much much faster and as one of you already pointed out inverter can be skewed because only one transition is important for us the other one is not even important so domino can be designed very very fast now look at it like this over here if i know that only after this comes here will this gate be evaluated do i even need a clock over here so what we say is okay let us remove the footer of the subsequent stages and when we remove the footer of the subsequent stages we are able to uh reduce some end masses also we can reduce the size of the n masses in this stack also and therefore gain further area are you able to see this yes but this can be done only if there is no static output coming to life this can be done only if this out one is going something like this and then there is other whatever now out one is coming here if out one was also in parallel with some other stuff then you can't do this then the ck has to be there are you able to see this sorry can you explain this point again yeah so why did we say that we will we will remove this footer transistor because we said that okay this this will get evaluated here and only after this gets evaluated can this output get discharged i know yes sir what does that mean that this first out one is in the same situation as a footer there is nothing in parallel to out one which would allow this logic to discharge the the capacitance over here yes sir yes now let us say if in parallel to out one there was some other signal also let us say e that was coming then you still need this okay right yes sir otherwise this this the output load over here will start to get discharged through this other part is basically i need to ensure that output out is the latest signal that is arriving yes so this footless domino this is called as footless domino uh can be uh has to be used only very carefully cannot be just uh or remove all the footer then go ahead it cannot work okay yes so carefully but you know what is being said is there is a scope of further optimization we were talking about n plus two we could possibly do with only n plus one then there is also this differential or dual rail domino where you have uh you know again possibly used for axar and xor kind of a thing where a and b and a bar and b bar all are used okay and you get the differential output also again as i said differential gates where you need that differential output to be driven okay so but here we can also get the inverting outputs right so yes and that is where we did not put in we did not bring the keeper uh input from after this inverter we said okay we will use it from here itself okay because the outputs are inverted one of the keepers is going to be on the other one is going to be off hmm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouihedF07RY,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouihedF07RY

uh ideas and they are being shared so that after you go home and if you come up with you know you you get inspired by these specific games and you can propose something new yourself also okay so okay yeah yes sir sir one confusion that i'm getting over here is uh sir how we are preserving the means uh total means logic actually total input to output logic how do you preserve that in a regular static cmos gate sir my confusion here is suppose we are implementing an sop suppose a b plus c d the first stage would be and gate next stage should be or gate so now here we are press if you are placing an inverter in between so means that no they are there demorgan's theorem you know that now so some kind of bubble pushing need to be made and land and representation something like that yes what's the big deal there that is a simpler part the other challenges that we discussed just now they are the more complex ones they breathe well pushing is so logical it is so simple so suppose you you have given me to design aoi in non-complex form in a uh where individual gates need to be also a dynamic gate so you will not ask me that uh suppose this is a and gate why we implement it using a nand gate we will just simply now input an output right yeah answer one more question here after we create the truth table that's it uh yes a truth table should be preserved input and output and one more thing here is that uh it's a keeper circuit how will how we can place that can we just show in the diagram keep a circuit in the character in the first level okay why why was this question there sir output capacitance increase over there at 0.135 by 0.2 it's a very small keeper so turning on the keeper would be not a problem or challenge anywhere that's and that is why you also design it to be very small huh yes sir you should understand thank you yeah so can we here also prefer that in this inverter can we prefer a high screen water here because we are only interested in the zero you tell me uh what was the if this inverter was not there what was the default state of input coming to this second pdf if this inverter was not there what would be this input's default state in the pre-charge state zero to one clockwise so if it is one then what happens after as soon as clock comes even before this one discharges this one would discharge yes sir we don't want that yes okay yes okay okay okay because inverter changes the default state to zero yes sir okay okay so yeah this is also explained in the animation over here now domino we just discussed why it is domino because only after the first one is evaluated the second one will be evaluated and the third one then the fourth one okay and uh again properties of domino only non-inverted logic can be can be implemented and because it is dynamic gate based and capacitances are reduced there is smaller logical effort this is much much faster and as one of you already pointed out inverter can be skewed because only one transition is important for us the other one is not even important so domino can be designed very very fast now look at it like this over here if i know that only after this comes here will this gate be evaluated do i even need a clock over here so what we say is okay let us remove the footer of the subsequent stages and when we remove the footer of the subsequent stages we are able to uh reduce some end masses also we can reduce the size of the n masses in this stack also and therefore gain further area are you able to see this yes but this can be done only if there is no static output coming to life this can be done only if this out one is going something like this and then there is other whatever now out one is coming here if out one was also in parallel with some other stuff then you can't do this then the ck has to be there are you able to see this sorry can you explain this point again yeah so why did we say that we will we will remove this footer transistor because we said that okay this this will get evaluated here and only after this gets evaluated can this output get discharged i know yes sir what does that mean that this first out one is in the same situation as a footer there is nothing in parallel to out one which would allow this logic to discharge the the capacitance over here yes sir yes now let us say if in parallel to out one there was some other signal also let us say e that was coming then you still need this okay right yes sir otherwise this this the output load over here will start to get discharged through this other part is basically i need to ensure that output out is the latest signal that is arriving yes so this footless domino this is called as footless domino uh can be uh has to be used only very carefully cannot be just uh or remove all the footer then go ahead it cannot work okay yes so carefully but you know what is being said is there is a scope of further optimization we were talking about n plus two we could possibly do with only n plus one then there is also this differential or dual rail domino where you have uh you know again possibly used for axar and xor kind of a thing where a and b and a bar and b bar all are used okay and you get the differential output also again as i said differential gates where you need that differential output to be driven okay so but here we can also get the inverting outputs right so yes and that is where we did not put in we did not bring the keeper uh input from after this inverter we said okay we will use it from here itself okay because the outputs are inverted one of the keepers is going to be on the other one is going to be off hmm"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,w0ZmNIo7A0Y,another way to cascade is using npc mass what does this mean that the first cooldown network if it is made out of nmos is then you cascade it with another gate which has not pulled down network but pull up network and this out 2 is recharged to 0 instead of 1. so this is a flipped dynamic gate and what is happening over here clock is coming so over here clock bar is coming you're working in two phases are you able to see this just looking at how to make this dynamic gate stuff more usable huh why we are doing this in pc mask thing you tell me inverter is not there anymore we've avoided the inverter because now we say if there is a pull up network it can accept one to zero transition see when the when pull down network was driving another pull down network then only zero to one transitions were allowed for that i had to put an inverter there now if i put a pull up network on the next gate then what happens one to zero transitions are also allowed are in fact only one to zero transitions are allowed so you don't you don't need those inverters in between so but we have removed an inverter and uh we are considering a circuit with uh with the p bosses so what about the area then yeah but think about the delay because inverters were adding delay now that delay is avoided okay okay okay so according to the application we have to decide yes according to the application you choose because at some places because you're using dynamic only for speed you may want more seats and then you can do this yes sir okay so yes i am so happy that all of you are now thinking like designers oh i have improved speed so what happened through area what is happening to power you have to continuously keep all the three things in mind when you design you cannot just design for speed and now over here if you are giving away that you know more area because of implementing it in pull up network you you realize that what is happening the speed is the speed is gaining you're consciously doing it yes sir okay so this saves you all those inverters there now this is nora logic which said that okay np to heihei i may want to couple this pdn with another pdn so i will also have an inverter over here and drive other pdns and similarly i may drive pdns from out to but i can have an inverter and drive other pums so this is further extension of the np logic that we talked over here are you able to see this so can we explain this once again let this load so what was there in np logic in np logic only this part was there anna listen now it may happen that for some particular gate implementation through p1 could be really very large area and due to that very large area itself you will not be able to gain speed yes can happen so you say okay let me use that that signal as pdn only for other signals that it drives i will use a pun so this is maximum flexible you have pdn driving a pdn in a domino format you have pdn driving a pun in an np format again even driving a pdn in an np format and p when driving a p1 in a domino format so this is a mix of domino and np but you also realize this is so much more complex to design is it not so many puns pdns everything to be designed so here even though my area is increasing i am able to drive three other outputs at a time so that you could have done earlier also that you could have done earlier also without saying that in the np in the previous slide when i was showing np i was saying that pdn is always followed by a pun yes sir over here i am saying in nora i am saying ok bring in an inverter and i can actually draw a pdn also in this case i'll be i should be increasing the size of my pdn in my first stage right because as it's depending on the logical effort you know yeah yeah we don't we don't go back to that thing again this is basics we already discussed they were fundamental you will naturally do that i expect you to do that sizing is now trivial sizing it is not trivial it is important but we've already understood sizing in much much detail earlier so let's not get bogged down by that over and over again at least in the class yes sir yes so yes i think you will have to do we will do anna it's not about the sizing it's about the increase of areas are exactly that's what i would area increase if there is no change in sizing sir obviously we are connecting a pdn to our output then i am supposed to increase my sizing accordingly of my previous stage okay yeah because you change the sizes that is where area increase now well actually i've got this concept but why i'm like integrating both kind of like in the nora like np also insecurity and the dynamic also integrating what exactly and benefit i'm not able to get clearly up on that let us say that you know the exact same doubt that uh faizal had asked uh that uh if you're using a p u n then the area of this p u n is increased yes sir huh so now let us say this p n is really complex and the area increases so much that those internal capacitances on the p masses they delay much more than an inverter would have delayed okay yes possible then you use a pdn only you say okay then an inverter plus pdn will be faster and also lesser area let me use a pdn button so one one gate is driving two different logics for one logic a pdn work better for another pu and work better and nora allows you to use both but how will the functionality uh how will the basically the internal connections will be made because i'm getting both connections right i bought to the point also the np connection also and the dynamic recognition also metal one that you have over here you will just take it somewhere else also yes sir so that is not the issue i'm asking that if i'm implementing a layout so i have implemented both i am dynamic dynamic and then and npc mos why i am integrating both kind of in the same itself i can pre-evaluate my key okay uh this kept this p1 could be more complex so i will not even implement it in the same design i will not that is where i will go to the pdn okay so you're not working at a standard cell now you're working at a cascading of these standard cells okay okay okay okay okay yes i've already moved to the cascading domino gates now dynamic gates section okay this is one this is one standard cell this is the other standard cell there would be another planet over here okay okay so i was getting confused with that okay okay thank you sir yeah anything else they did yes or one small question regarding the non-complex implementation only so sir we can do it in two ways right using the domino logic or the footless domino or uh dynamic cascaded after dynamic where we might need two inverters in between two inverters no two inverters again the terms the challenge comes with the transition they breathe your delay increases season not the delay the transitions you only want zero to one transitions happening zero to one transition that is the chapter so between domino and focus domino uh yes sir yes so between the domino and footless domino sir means what we should do in means in our project for non-complex influence domino because you're making only one cell you're not making a path so for the other stage dweller paths you can use footless also in the second stage but just see if it works for you if it doesn't then don't sir my domino is only expected right so if someone may oh yes okay tell you so class we will close now and uh next class there is this presentation monday we have the quiz we'll meet on next wednesday now we'll meet on monday also office hours and then next wednesday okay sir yes uh actually i need to talk to you regarding something else okay we can wait i will stop the recording so regarding first presentation can i ask one more thing sir so for non-complex implementation just said that just the functionality and schematic would be enough and for complex if we do the till the layout simulation so see all these instructions are already clarified on the classroom now let's go with that only okay okay if there is some further clarification in it ask on the classroom everyone will get to know abi there are only 33 students in the class it was not fair okay uh sir yes yeah [Music] you have a question yes sir i have my question is related to project finding dynamo actually what i did is as you said in the office server i remove the minimum drc to raise the maximum and most sizes in that uh in that space i got the possibility of the nmos somewhere i can place the minimum and mass somewhere i can place the maximum and and as you said the footer should be a maximum one so that the delays will be lesser and what i planned is that the the nmos which is near to the output i'll try to keep it as a minimum one so what i am seeing is that when these transistors are coming in series they see the current capabilities will be different like the smallest one which should be the one with the limiting one yeah so uh the the size which i increase the footer that i am not using actually it won't change anything for you yeah so keeping the footer maximum is not useful anything like no if i make it as as similar as the one which is near to the output then i can use the lesser area yes even if area doesn't change at least your leakage will reduce gate capacitances will reduce clock load will reduce but the delays uh the alias will be increasing the list will be almost similar because there is something which is equivalent resistance already there okay one more question is there sir as i trace the animal sizes and all now i'll simulate on all things to know the maximum frequency at what the maximum frequency i can do and the voltages but i think the designing process should be the reverse like you should have given us the frequency and the vdd based on that we should design right no you're designing a standard cell so you just i told you one thing that no more area loss so every time the design should be start for the dynamo i think the design should be start from the layout are the standard cells for the standard cells you know this is a template this is the size if you were designing free flow circuits you know not standard cells and then you would do all that oh this is my load then let's go back and see what should be the size of the driver or what should be the size of the penalty my driver and so on then you go that way otherwise you simply drop okay so whenever the standard cell is made so we have to first made it and then the layout is the one which determines the sizes primarily then if you want better speed you use those uh buffers after your complex gate yeah one more question is you have given 70 for the annual i didn't understand why you are giving this because when i am choosing uh pmos as small as possible then in and most uh the some area is still left in the annual area which i am using for the rooting purpose so i think if if that 70 constraint is removed the area so that is the standard cell so that is the standard cell constraint we can't remove that thank you so much thank you okay that is the standard cell constraint that we have set for our library okay because we also are going to design static seam updates that is where we have kept that

Transcript: another way to cascade is using npc mass what does this mean that the first cooldown network if it is made out of nmos is then you cascade it with another gate which has not pulled down network but pull up network and this out 2 is recharged to 0 instead of 1. so this is a flipped dynamic gate and what is happening over here clock is coming so over here clock bar is coming you're working in two phases are you able to see this just looking at how to make this dynamic gate stuff more usable huh why we are doing this in pc mask thing you tell me inverter is not there anymore we've avoided the inverter because now we say if there is a pull up network it can accept one to zero transition see when the when pull down network was driving another pull down network then only

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,aa14b6AXSzg,sequential circuits yes so today we will start with sequential circuits this is uh as you will notice later when you will appear for interviews or anything this is one of the most uh how do i put it one of the most widely asked topics in your interviews so please pay sufficient attention to this topic ask as many questions as you wish to not exactly on the basics of these circuits but finally you know probably today or in the next session and we will work on the timing diagrams on the timing constraints linked to sequential circuits then there will be you know those kind of questions are usually asked in the interviews in the interviews and the written tests and all that so that you should really be very clear of so sequential circuits is a very important topic we use sequential circuits in our designs very very regularly so what are sequential circuits and how are they different from combinational circuits anyone so the output of a sequential circuit should depend upon the previous input and present input as on the other hand the combination only depends on the present input okay any other ideas suggestions so gandhi said that output of a sequential circuit depends on previous input and present input both or previous output and present input both whereas output of a combinational circuit is dependent only on present input so that is the key difference between sequential circuits and combinational circuits and this you know what this also means is that we need to because there is a sense of previous state and current state and let us say a future state what will be the output and how will the next uh state be dependent on it and so on because it requires that kind of a thing we need something which is called as state or tokens this is uh these these this previous set of inputs and current set of inputs and the future outputs all this is clubbed and called as a state or also a token in some texts you will see the word token also used somewhere and where do we see them finite state machines all of us know we've seen melee machine mode machine and all that you remember on at state machines and pipelines also you must have heard hello yes yes so pipelines finite state machines these are some common places where you will you will have to use sequential circuits sequential circuits or the sequencing when i say that there is uh some input uh dependence on uh you know that the there is a com so this combinational logic over here uh and there is this flop over here so whatever happened in the previous cycle will define what will happen in the next cycle over here so all that all this dependence is uh comes with an overhead or with comes with a with a penalty so what happens is that if let us say in this particular pipeline if if or how do i put it let us say that if there are combinational paths and we know that the slowest path or let me show the slowest path in a different way let me say this is the slowest path and the fastest path would never intersect then we are safe however if the slowest path and the fastest path for example are going to converge into some cone or something like that then it may happen that we may have glitches on the output of this nand gate are you able to see this what i am saying let us see there are two inputs one input comes very fast the other input comes very slowly then what can happen is that in an intermediate state when this input has reached but the other one has not reached i could get glitters and these glitters or we may not really call it glitches we may get spurious transitions are you able to see this so so when we are considering the combinational logic only then i don't exactly control key how the inputs are going to be arriving or when they're going right in another like in an adder there is some path which is longer so it will take longer time to come yes sir okay there are some paths which are longer some paths which are shorter so shorter paths will come to the nand gate longer paths will come later so there will be some states that will appear these fourier states not only mean more power consumption but also extra toggling and and possibly corruption of state machine elsewhere so if we cannot ensure that the flow of information will be uh will be always synchronized we use what is called as tokens or we use what is called as flip flops so when when for example in a fiber optic cable you know that you send this pulse okay this pulse and any other pulse will all travel at same speed which is the speed of light am i right there are light pulses just the amplitude of the pulses higher or lower the speed of the pulse will exactly be the same so you do not need to put any sequencing elements in in a optical fiber you say it's fine my light will always travel with the speed c it is only the dispersion between the pulses that defines how what is the minimum time between two pulses however in terms of uh hardware in terms of our circuits we cannot always ensure that the slow paths will be able to catch up with the fast path and so on and therefore we need to break the hardware path and use what we call as flip flops or latches to delay these fast signals this fast path we say okay before entering this and gate i will have a series of flip flops,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa14b6AXSzg,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa14b6AXSzg
Transcript: sequential circuits yes so today we will start with sequential circuits this is uh as you will notice later when you will appear for interviews or anything this is one of the most uh how

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,zow_CFimPxs,then in that case you will get outputs which are not correct intermittently that much is clear we just looked at the example of a nand gate we don't even go into a complex gate like an adder or something like that even in a simple nand gate do you realize that if one input comes much later than the other there will be a differential there will be a spurious output there for some time so why am calling that spurious because whatever becomes i will get the according functionality in me yeah because i have now and now i will say that i wanted the addition of two words to be done okay just so so anything that is intermediate is spurious for me now what is it that i want i want there is one correct output and then there is directly a next correct output any intermediate state has spurious states for me okay right okay yes okay that is what i mean by spurious okay i'm only concerned with some kind of outputs not all yes yeah so okay and so one more thing so one thing also said the concept of token exactly what exactly you were trying to say is that is it the value that is the whole being held or the the data that might be coming in going out token could be okay token could be something which is like uh when the state of this signal is zero only then i will proceed forward it is like a you've seen a relay race sir in which what happens the first first first runner carries a baton with him and puts it on to the uh gives it on to the second runner after some time yes yes sir i know so this uh this is like a token that only after my previous set of results are there only then i will start my second operation so in asynchronous circuit you call it as tokens in uh synchronous circuits you call of it as state where flip flop the way the clock would come and say okay now next now let's move to the next stage in asynchronous circuits you call it as token okay so somehow it's linked to the inputs and output like when i achieve this kind of output i can move to the next set of inputs something like that yes so there is one okay now let us look at it like this there could be a special output that your circuit would give which says that okay now i am ready for the next input okay when all the calculations have done have been completed it says now i'm ready for the next input now once this ready input ready signal goes high then you will give the next set of inputs so this ready signal is a token now okay okay okay so like it's like the concept of moving from one competition to the next that kind of okay yeah it is managing that okay yes so it is about sequencing that was what you were talking about in the last slide also yes you were talking about sequencing where we said that uh in an optical fiber that in an optical fiber we said that things would move in a in a wave format anna whereas uh it may not happen so in the uh it may not happen so in the hardware that we're talking about yes so when that is what we're talking about then we say that this is about sequencing delays does this help so sir we are moving towards sequencing because we want to avoid those kind of spurious kind of that yeah transitions token to something like a acknowledgement signal yes sir uh what i know about the pipelines so what uh according to whatever we have read also basically to make the overall circuit faster so what we do is to separate two blocks of circuit and put flip flops in between so that the output of previous one is not able to interact with the input of the next stage until i send the clock signal so sir even even if the delays of all the transitions of input for both the circuit the stage 1 and state 2 are are similar or or let's say are constant even then to make the circuit faster i will like to put flip flops or not even then i would want to do that yes even then i would want to do that so how are we saying that okay constant if it is constant then i can rema remove the flip flops uh if it is constant i will remove the flip flops because even after removing the flip flops i will get the correct functionality the speed will be slower okay so for speed i will still need to put them and yeah functionality so then you are using flip flops only for speed purposes otherwise you're using pipelining also for sequencing purposes is that clear yes it is so what we are saying is there are two purposes of uh of using these sequencing circuits first is to ensure sequencing second is to improve overall system throughput system throughput need would still remain but in wave pipelining you can say that okay i do not need to uh no i do not need to give this keep these flip flops or sequencing elements in between because i am always safe so yes rather so i am mean i am improving the speed of the circuit because i'm able to achieve kind of parallelism kind of thing that is why i'm able to achieve it yeah right okay yes so are all of you doing the computer architecture course anyone who's not doing the ca course okay at least those who are present in the class okay leap is not oh some people are not doing c a course so those of you doing cf codes you would see that cma this concept is discussed in in much detail why pipelining is used why it is important and so on so pipelining is used for two purposes as we are discussing over here first is to ensure sequencing that the earlier inputs don't mix with the with the present set of inputs or vice versa and we also saying that sequential elements of pipelining is used to improve overall throughput of the system okay now when we use these sequencing elements in our paths what do we do we inevitably add flip flops and latches and they will inevitably lead to additional delays even on the slower paths see there was a slow path you wanted to slow down only the fast path but you do not know which path is slow which path is fast when you are doing a system synthesis in that case what happens in that case finally we say that we simply insert a flop on all the paths and even the slow paths we'll see some delay this additional delay that is that this flip flop would take or this latch would take is called as clocking overhead or sequencing overhead so actually it is called last sequencing overhead but a few people erroneously call it as clocking overhead clocking over it is not the correct term because as i just mentioned a little while back this kind of overhead even occurs in the token system if you have tokens so even in token systems there is going to be some overhead so it is better to call it as sequencing overhead and not clocking overhead is that okay any questions till here so suppose we are putting uh one flip flop in the path uh so the clocking overhead will be one clock period so i've just now said pfizer we will not use the term clocking over it we will use the term sequence string overhead sequencing overhead would be one clock period like eight o'clock at the flip flop they take output no the sequencing overhead will be the the the delay of the flop that is ck to q delay of the flop c q to q okay okay because that is the additional delay that your logic now has to travel now yes yes sir yes understood okay okay so that becomes the delay that is the sequencing overhead we will talk about sequencing overhead in much detail after we introduce these sequencing elements to you we'll talk about the sequencing overhead and much detail in a little while yes sir um so you were saying that typically we don't know the slower and faster path uh when we synthesize the circuit but again that's i think at system level we typically do know right that yeah at the time of synthesis we would know but at the time of writing an rtl we may not know so you would put the flop everywhere and then you synthesize so what i meant was that before synthesis we do not we may not really know which circuits which paths are fast which paths are slow because during synthesis also some paths will be converted to faster paths by using faster cells and slower cells and all that so we the in rtl itself will put the flops at all the places okay okay okay so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zow_CFimPxs,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zow_CFimPxs
Transcript: then in that case you will get outputs which are not correct intermittently that much is clear we just looked at the example of a nand gate we don't even go into a complex gate like an adder or something like that even in a simple nand gate do you realize that if one input comes much later than the other there will be a differential there will be a spurious output there for some time so why am calling that spurious because whatever becomes i will get the according functionality in me yeah because i have now and now i will say that i wanted the addition of two words to be done okay just so so anything that is intermediate is spurious for me now what is it that i want i want there is one correct output and then there is directly a next correct output any intermediate state has spurious states for me okay right okay yes okay that is what i mean by spurious okay i'm only concerned with some kind of outputs not all yes yeah so okay and so one more thing so one thing also said the concept of token exactly what exactly you were trying to say is that is it the value that is the whole being held or the the data that might be coming in going out token could be okay token could be something which is like uh when the state of this signal is zero only then i will proceed forward it is like a you've seen a relay race sir in which what happens the first first first runner carries a baton with him and puts it on to the uh gives it on to the second runner after some time yes yes sir i know so this uh this is like a token that only after my previous set of results are there only then i will start my second operation so in asynchronous circuit you call it as tokens in uh synchronous circuits you call of it as state where flip flop the way the clock would come and say okay now next now let's move to the next stage in asynchronous circuits you call it as token okay so somehow it's linked to the inputs and output like when i achieve this kind of output i can move to the next set of inputs something like that yes so there is one okay now let us look at it like this there could be a special output that your circuit would give which says that okay now i am ready for the next input okay when all the calculations have done have been completed it says now i'm ready for the next input now once this ready input ready signal goes high then you will give the next set of inputs so this ready signal is a token now okay okay okay so like it's like the concept of moving from one competition to the next that kind of okay yeah it is managing that okay yes so it is about sequencing that was what you were talking about in the last slide also yes you were talking about sequencing where we said that uh in an optical fiber that in an optical fiber we said that things would move in a in a wave format anna whereas uh it may not happen so in the uh it may not happen so in the hardware that we're talking about yes so when that is what we're talking about then we say that this is about sequencing delays does this help so sir we are moving towards sequencing because we want to avoid those kind of spurious kind of that yeah transitions token to something like a acknowledgement signal yes sir uh what i know about the pipelines so what uh according to whatever we have read also basically to make the overall circuit faster so what we do is to separate two blocks of circuit and put flip flops in between so that the output of previous one is not able to interact with the input of the next stage until i send the clock signal so sir even even if the delays of all the transitions of input for both the circuit the stage 1 and state 2 are are similar or or let's say are constant even then to make the circuit faster i will like to put flip flops or not even then i would want to do that yes even then i would want to do that so how are we saying that okay constant if it is constant then i can rema remove the flip flops uh if it is constant i will remove the flip flops because even after removing the flip flops i will get the correct functionality the speed will be slower okay so for speed i will still need to put them and yeah functionality so then you are using flip flops only for speed purposes otherwise you're using pipelining also for sequencing purposes is that clear yes it is so what we are saying is there are two purposes of uh of using these sequencing circuits first is to ensure sequencing second is to improve overall system throughput system throughput need would still remain but in wave pipelining you can say that okay i do not need to uh no i do not need to give this keep these flip flops or sequencing elements in between because i am always safe so yes rather so i am mean i am improving the speed of the circuit because i'm able to achieve kind of parallelism kind of thing that is why i'm able to achieve it yeah right okay yes so are all of you doing the computer architecture course anyone who's not doing the ca course okay at least those who are present in the class okay leap is not oh some people are not doing c a course so those of you doing cf codes you would see that cma this concept is discussed in in much

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,6tkTisETmDA,now what kind of sequential circuits do we already know of so two circuits essentially latches and flip flops latches are level sensitive flip flops are edge triggered uh just to differentiate between the latches and the flip flops let us look at this timing at the top signal is clock data toggled when did data toggle data toggled when the clock was high since data toggles then what happened when data toggled latch and the clock was high latch immediately reflected transition of data onto the output flip flop on the other hand was edge triggered the rising edge of the clock had already passed so this data this toggling of data was not recorded by the latch now data toggled again now since at this point of time clock was low even the latch was opaque it was not transparent yet when clock went high both flop and the latch gave the right output right order means they reflected d on cube are you able to see this difference the key difference between a latch and a flock how level sensitive and s triggered sequential elements are different so again it is elaborate on this transparent energy okay so when i use the term transparent i mean to say that whatever comes on b it will be transmitted on q and opaque means it is not it will not be transmitted is it clear so so whatever appears on d will anyway we translated you realize this yes sir whereas the latch is transparent through the entire clock high period okay okay that is the difference yes so i mean if the clock if it is uh at the positive edge of the clock so will the clock transition on the clock slew will determine like how effectively how what for extractive timeline the flip flop will be on for like if my for example slew is more so will i say that uh key uh my flip-flop is transparent for much greater time so flip flop will uh will transmit whatever is there on the rising edge uh we will just now in a little while see that to get a correct output on the flip flop you will have to ensure that data is stable for some time before the clock arrives that is called as a setup time yes sir so we will ensure that there is no uncertainty at the output rather okay through different timing constraints because otherwise you're absolutely right if the clock slew is very bad or something like that is there then how will we ensure what data is coming at the output so that is where we have two timings set up and hold timings associated with the flop or a latch or anything like that so is it something like designers tend to prefer flip flops over latches do designers in general prefer flip flop over latches why so i it's just a question so i have not seen latches many that many places even in fpgas there are very few notches and most of them are flip flops only yeah see what happens is that uh now let us say this this intermediate d going high and low was a spurious transition it was see it went high then went low so it was a glitch what did the latch to last transmitted the glitch to the other side so all the signals on the other side also started to toggle hmm so lots of power got wasted yes in a flop all that did not happen in a flop i said okay now this one clock period is the time for this combination circuit to evaluate let it evaluate completely only after it has evaluated i will sample it so the intermediate transitions are no longer bothersome for the subsequent part of the circuit okay therefore are preferred at many places okay so answer or whatever timing is timing also somehow better for flip flop and instead of analysis we create problems whenever we use latches so let us wait for the next lecture we will see what is the timing overhead of flop and latch okay i will cover that okay that's a very relevant question but we are anyway going to cover that in the next class let us just go step by step uh sir in the timing diagram drawn below sir sir uh when is this latch is transparent and opaque according to this now you tell me sir according to me when the clock is zero uh and d is zero then and when then q is become 0 then here the latch must be opaque and when the clock is 1 and this q is 1 then it must be transparency because uh according to me sir opening or opaque is just reverse of transparent so when the latch is off then whatever is on q must be like opaque answer so if you if you look at it you will realize there is no dependence on the value on d yes or transparent matlab uh that the latch must be offset q must be independent of when in for opaque when is it opaque when uh depending upon the clock when the latch is either on or off when the clock is low then this particular latch is opaque because whatever is the value of d it is not coming on q okay so in the transparent one d will reflect on yes when the clock was one then latch is transparent so whatever d was there it reflected on q whether d was zero whether d was one whatever it was it reflected on q so transparent and opaque of the latch is dependent on the clock level that is why latch is called as level sensitive yes flip flop is instead called as edge trigger because whatever we see on the clock rising edge or falling edge whatever edge triggered you are that is what will be sampled and that is what will be used whatever happens intermediately we will ignore that we will not use that yes fine okay instead of a flip flop so then uh wanted to be that i will have only the negative edge for the evaluation for the block of combination circuit if we use negative edge of the clock for the flip flop then the next sampling of data will also happen at the next negative edge yes but i can do the evaluation over the complete time period of the clock yes because it will then be negative s to negative s so i will still have the entire time period with me yes in the latch it won't be a half time period will be available you will see latch has some other benefits [Laughter] otherwise i would not be telling you about it no yes yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tkTisETmDA,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tkTisETmDA

you about it no yes yeah"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,Go0s1-8WaUQ,will see the benefit of the last layer okay sir okay so now this is the oldest latch do you see this is a latch when c k is high d or q follows d when c k is low q is independent of d are you able to see this yes yes what are the challenges on what are the benefits of this latch uh sir we are feeding to the uh diffusion part of the transistor okay diffusion input and so this is a benefit or loss plus loss okay what else i've said a two two latches in parallel if the output output is shorted then because this is a pass transistor we can have like input being driven from the output kind of thing okay the output can end up driving the input good very good what else so dt drops vt drop very good see the first first thing let us look at the benefit the benefit is that it's just one transistor latch just one transistor so it's tiny and also very low clock load but cons oh as you just said vt drop output input on diffusion output being able to drive the input and all that and i'm back driving everything all these are losses or cons of using this kind of a latch and output noise sensitivity also so lots of negatives so what do we do we change the design we say that okay uh let us use a transmission gate latch at least we did drop all our problems all over so vt drop a lot of problem solver but what happens now i require an inverted clock also i am still on diffusion inputs i still may have back driving all those things will still remain though vt drop problem is solved so i want to solve other problems also so what do we do cascade with inverter yeah so we we say that okay let me put an inverter at the output now the output cannot drive the input or let me put an inverter on the input now the input is no longer deriving a diffusion so what happened i could first i have restoring output then no back driving and fixes either output noise sensitivity or diffusion input problem are you able to see this but either of those two not both of them so what would be a better solution then so how is the pack driving problem getting solved here so now tell me can q drive d q is going to the drain and and cannot transmit it to the x node over here so q cannot drive d now so back driving is not a problem now can i use two inverters at the input one at the input another at the output yeah can we use both inverters at both input and output yes we could so see we have we are using it over here invert input is also inverter output is also inverter more importantly even before that you know just because this latch is still dynamic in nature you see the charge on node x is is sensitive to noise hannah this latches through dynamic in nature when the q q bar will go off when this transmission gate will go off then this q bar will be floating i know so first an important thing is to solve this problem first so we say okay we add feedback we add feedback so that there is no dynamic node now so i have reduced the sensitivity of the output however in this setting there is back driving risk therefore what do we do we say feedback we dial there and we add the inverter on the input also and you will see it fixes diffusion input problem also this is non-inverting and uh there is like if you if you size it no in fact in the sizing keyboard any eye when you want this path to be active this path will be off so there is no back driving also are you able to see this sir can you explain this actually it's getting after that uh for example when they when we had only one inverter cascaded it solved our problem for the back driving one but after that what we did exactly so even when that one inverter was put do you realize that there were nodes which were not driven when the clock was off there were floating nodes there where the charge was stored on some gate or some capacitance so if the if the inverter was at the output like after the transmission gate then i won't be getting uh floating right the output is floating now now here in the second one is floating with the above one is not floating right above one excess floating okay right okay therefore output becomes floating yes okay i know so by coding things are important to fix first so therefore we first talked about adding a tristate why can't we use the beekeeper or level restorer to me to make sure that we won't float that x position which we were so that is what feedback is now look at this what is this level restorer for the dynamic gate level restorer was a simple pmos for a static date for for an inverter the output can be both zero and one so the level resource has to be an inverter that is what we have put yes yes yes sir honestly we've done that only yes does that we've used a tri-state over here why did we use a tricep and not a simple inverter to make the driving of x easier for me if it was a latch then inverting it through d would be a challenge yes if it was if this was not a tri-state if it was an inverter then this inverter would be driving x and this d will be driving x and it will be difficult to write into x so can you elaborate exactly why between try scenes of inverter and you could get it okay let us say it was we said that we just want to put a level restorer that is what was asked vaishnav said let us put a level restorer so uh for an inverter the level restorer would mean a feedback inverter instead of half flaps we put a full latch am i right hello have you understood this part why do i need a full inverter not just a pmos zero and one stable at x position so in a dynamic gate your output could only be zero could only go to zero yes sir so you only you always knew that if the output goes to zero then if that is when i need to or when the output remains one that is when i need to maintain the out maintain the output there yes in this case it's a latch how does this is zero and one both okay so you need to maintain both zero and once we need to put an inverter yes yes is it clear no sir now if i put an inverter what happens this let us say this was zero earlier so this will drive this at one am i right yes sir now when i turn the clock on z wants to write into this yes sir but this inverter is driving back yeah okay so b wanted so d wanted to discharge this but this inverter is also charging this up yes sir so this is a file condition hello yes sir now if we put a tri-state what happens if i put a tri-state over here what happens now so we are synchronizing the input to x appropriately so that i won't get in a condition that at a time these both get into a conflict so when this path is active this would be off look at it when phi is equal to 1 this nmos is on phi bar is equal to 0 so this pmos is also on d is trying to write to x but when phi is equal to 1 it is going to the pmos over here so this tri-state will no longer be driving yes huh so now you've removed the fighting conditions so we've actually done the level restorative stuff only just made it safer so can't it also be done by using a feedback inverter but a smaller feedback inverter so that it doesn't fight back which feedback inverter so uh we earlier drawn like that sram type cell so uh we just below this bottom inverter which is used for feedback we can size it so small that it doesn't fight back yeah but then you know about variations now yes so what can variations do variations can make you this inverter very strong so how strong i mean i am designing it to be so so small so yeah but even then what's the harm in putting it into a tri-state you are guaranteeing functionality independent of any variations you are guaranteeing functionality when you put it at high state is it not yes sir that's why so clock load would decrease i know but functionality is more important so what's the internal structure of this tri-state buffer oh you don't know the triassic buffer i i don't so tristate buffer sorry i've assumed that upload when it tries to buffer today so if i say this is input and this is output then there will be ck bar going over and ck going over here so that when ck is equal to 1 this acts as an inverter okay yes sir yes so it's just an inverter only we just clocked it yes sir so that it does not fight back the forward path when needed okay yes so i mean uh for example in the simple when we had only cascaded the inverter after the x node and i know that the x is basically my floating uh high so for example so is it i'm only concerned with the output when it is a high impedance one because then because zero to hamara zero it's good like right zero would be why why is zero good there is a there is a metal running next to this node x and it is going from zero to one it will couple a charge one on this x okay so but like is it i am considering the kind of worst case like it will uh going above or below the bdd by two positions you are a designer you cannot leave anything to chance i just gave you a failure mode you cannot think beyond that now whether circuit can fail you can no longer use it okay so you have to find another solution so so like we can't rely on the cascaded inverter to restore the kind of cascade inverter so so this inverter only like simple single inverter that we have cascade after the transmission gauge over the credit store it does not even drive if you have just one inverter on the output no feedback how will the output of the inverter restore the input you know so if it is in the if the variation is in within the noise margins then it can restore right then it can oh in the dynamic gates we looked at the dynamic gates before the system why did we look at the dynamic gates first because in dynamic dates we saw that there's nothing that can help you to restore yes yes how will what will restore over here tell me so i'm thinking for example if x is there if x is at one and it suffers commodore decay so its uh voltage will drop but if it is if the drop is within the noise margin of the inverter then how do you control it within the noise margin okay right that is the challenge yes now you cannot control it now you to control it you have to put this kind of a feedback yes yes sir okay rajneesh sir when this clock is zero sir that is when this transmission gate is off and this uh this tri-state uh feedback this turns on so any value on this uh q bar so may this x so still those advantages but this much correct and all of our operation may get so disturbed so will x and q bar not always be inverted inverted and out inverted of each other versions of each other no sir when this above latch is off and this when this below uh this tri-state buffer is on in that case haha so d is no longer driving now no sir yes b had driven x to some value yes and x had driven q to some value q bar to some value yes so q x is equal to inverter inverted off value of q bar x is already equal to that am i right yes sir but sir any glitch on this q bar may uh change this x suppose some q bar will change so that is the noise margin of a latch yes so that that is a different thing see that is the noise margin of this latch now yes so you're talking about an entirely different asset but if there is no noise then there is no problem am i right yes no noise means even if there is some noise which leads to some slight dips not a glitch and yes are you able to see the difference between a dip and a glitch uh depending glitch sir glitch will happen in q bar and deep will happen on this ex no no no no so glitch means glitch means that there is something which is some rise or fall some some transition on the signal is so large that the subsequent stage samples it as it as a change in input yes sir okay that is a glitch so that is a hazard actually what happens is qp you you you coupled so much of noise on q rising noise on q let us say that is a q bar sorry it's q bar over here you coupled so much noise on the q bar that uh x actually sends that q bar is equal to 0 and then x will go to 1 let us say yes so in that case we say that the noise margin of the latch has been corrupted yes okay but if someone is within that noise margin then the latch will restore x to 0 and q bar to 1 at all times yes which if you did not have a feedback would not have been done restoring could not have been possible yes sir one thing sir sir but when you added this buffer uh in front of transmission gate you told that there is no back driving disk and after that we added this tri-state buffer so can this queue bar affect the d at any instance possible now c now q bar will q bar will drive x through this tri-state and therefore q bar can end up driving b also if there is a situation if there is a situation where phi and phi bar they have a they have some delay between them yes so much loves are back driving the b o g w tri-state buffer or uh transmission with no except on driver yes that is why we just call it a risk we are not saying it will it will happen we are saying there is a risk it can happen or maybe it will depend upon our circuit it will depend on the timing variation between phi and fiber okay yes yes okay sir this uh basically this type of latch that you have drawn back-to-back inverter this moves in the sram cell so sir there there will kind of largely ignore this diffusion input and or and all those problems are there also i'm driving a pass gate in the sram center uh so sram cell uh is a different thing we will look at scam cell and we will cover that topic okay sram cell is never driven by a system input sram cell is always driven by something which is within your control as a circuit designer so you can always characterize it and you can always manage it so i know that what is in the proximity of the cell and what are the loads sram cell is very controlled it is used in a very controlled environment so we can use do it over there we cannot do it elsewhere okay okay so our tri-state buffer is essentially a better version of transmission gate so why are we using transmission so you can use transmission gates also yes uh no i i said uh tristate is a better version of transmission gates yeah so sorry you can use tri-state so in fact you will see that in flip flops there are transmission gate versions of flip flops and there are tri-state versions of flip-flops both exist okay it's more transistors in a in a tri-state there's an inversion also happening in a tri-state so uh due to area constraints or due to inversion constraints you may not want to use a trans try state everywhere so there are both versions that exist okay yes so raghav uh yes sir there were two properties early in the slides one was output noise sensitivity and non-restoring non-restoring uh i get it but like output now are they aren't they too linked actually that autonomous sensitivity or not the story so can you elaborate on the like the output noise sensitivity here for this kind of design so in this one output noise sensitivity is not there because output is driven to driven by an inverter yes sir but if the if the buffer was placed on the input in this case there is output my sensitivity i know when this transmission gate is off then output is floating yes that is what output my sensitivity is okay okay answer in the this uh last slide only uh what exactly you're talking about the leakage part this in the la in the next uh in the last slide leakage so yeah static this leakage point sir yeah so it says that uh because uh there are leaking circuits today and there are uh let us say if if this feedback was not there uh that x is getting uh getting disturbed because of crosstalk noise what they are saying is that what is being written in the slide over here is that this leakage will also happen which can degrade x either this way or the spherical can happen both sides you know so because of this leakage and this leakage becoming actually a big problem today you anyways need a feedback in in advanced technologies even if you say my system has no crosstalk because of leakage you will still need feedback so so this leakage problem will be existing for all kind of designs that we have seen till now yes so this then has a buffered input which fixes the diffusion input problem makes the latch non-inverting in itself and also fixes the problem linked to output noise sensitivity and so on and this is a situation there is separate inverter which drives q so any noise on q see you're still asking that there is some noise on q and that can impact x i know we were discussing this just a little while back yes avoid this problem what is done is we say that okay let us separate the q buffer now whatever happens here happens here only this latch in itself is safe this feedback loop will ensure that x remains at a stable value but you see this is such so much bigger than the first latch that we talked about hannah this is so much bigger than that clock load has increased so much but it is still very widely used because it is the most robust one is that okay so so i just wanted to ask for example in the complex gate designing that we're doing the if you are not considering the ptl based design logic then the diffusion input kind of scenario won't be occurring right for us [Music] if we are not considering the why transformation it may be the diffusion input [Music] so but like um for the static and dynamic we are we won't be getting that diffusion input case because we would be driving the gates only right if you're designing the complex case yeah but if you draw if you design a complex with transmission gates even then there is diffusion input yes yes sir even transmission gets okay right right so abhinav hello uh so in previous slide when we are talking about that risk when tri-state buffer that feedback part is driving our input d [Music] so we are discussing that if there is any delay between clock and clock bar then back driving may happen it it might be a risk basically we are taking clock and clockwise independent people right or we are diving clock bar from clock so you tell me what would you do as a designer as a designer i think clock and clockwise should be independent to avoid that risk should be independent means would you put two plls there sorry will you use two plls there two clock generators there uh no sir but uh so if you have same clock generator then you have to generate ck and ck bar can they be exactly the same phase or can there be exactly 180 degrees apart so wherever you are generating clock bar whether it is in the pll and then you are routing making a full clock tree for clock bar also or you're saying taking clock inside your latch and inverting it there itself and using it whatever you choose do you realize that there will be some delay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go0s1-8WaUQ,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go0s1-8WaUQ
Transcript: will see the benefit of the last layer okay sir okay so now this is the oldest latch do you see this is a latch when c k is high d or q follows d when c k is low q is independent of d are you able to see this yes yes what are the challenges on what are the benefits of this latch uh sir we are feeding to the uh diffusion part of the transistor okay diffusion input and so this is a benefit or loss plus loss okay what else i've said a two two latches in parallel if the output output is shorted then because this is a pass transistor we can have like input being driven from the output kind of thing okay the output can end up driving the input good very good what else so dt drops vt drop very good see the first first thing let us look at the benefit the benefit is that it's just one transistor latch just one transistor so it's tiny and also very low clock load but cons oh as you just said vt drop output input on diffusion output being able to drive the input and all that and i'm back driving everything all these are losses or cons of using this kind of a latch and output noise sensitivity also so lots of negatives so what do we do we change the design we say that okay uh let us use a transmission gate latch at least we did drop all our problems all over so vt drop a lot of problem solver but what happens now i require an inverted clock also i am still on diffusion inputs i still may have back driving all those things will still remain though vt drop problem is solved so i want to solve other problems also so what do we do cascade with inverter yeah so we we say that okay let me put an inverter at the output now the output cannot drive the input or let me put an inverter on the input now the input is no longer deriving a diffusion so what happened i could first i have restoring output then no back driving and fixes either output noise sensitivity or diffusion input problem are you able to see this but either of those two not both of them so what would be a better solution then so how is the pack driving problem getting solved here so now tell me can q drive d q is going to the drain and and cannot transmit it to the x node over here so q cannot drive d now so back driving is not a problem now can i use two inverters at the input one at the input another at the output yeah can we use both inverters at both input and output yes we could so see we have we are using it over here invert input is also inverter output is also inverter more importantly even before that you know just because this latch is still dynamic in nature you see the charge on node x is is sensitive to noise hannah this latches through dynamic in nature when the q q bar will go off when this transmission gate will go off then this q bar will be floating i know so first an important thing is to solve this problem first so we say okay we add feedback we add feedback so that there is no dynamic node now so i have reduced the sensitivity of the output however in this setting there is back driving risk therefore what do we do we say feedback we dial there and we add the inverter on the input also and you will see it fixes diffusion input problem also this is non-inverting and uh there is like if you if you size it no in fact in the sizing keyboard any eye when you want this path to be active this path will be off so there is no back driving also are you able to see this sir can you explain this actually it's getting after that uh for example when they when we had only one inverter cascaded it solved our problem for the back driving one but after that what we did exactly so even when that one inverter was put do you realize that there were nodes which were not driven when the clock was off there were floating nodes there where the charge was stored on some gate or some capacitance so if the if the inverter was at the output like after the transmission gate then i won't be getting uh floating right the output is floating now now here in the second one is floating with the above one is not floating right above one excess floating okay right okay therefore output becomes floating yes okay i know so by coding things are important to fix first so therefore we first talked about adding a tristate why can't we use the beekeeper or level restorer to me to make sure that we won't float that x position which we were so that is what feedback is now look at this what is this level restorer for the dynamic gate level restorer was a simple pmos for a static date for for an inverter the output can be both zero and one so the level resource has to be an inverter that is what we have put yes yes yes sir honestly we've done that only yes does that we've used a tri-state over here why did we use a tricep and not a simple inverter to make the driving of x easier for me if it was a latch then inverting it through d would be a challenge yes if it was if this was not a tri-state if it was an inverter then this inverter would be driving x and this d will be driving x and it will be difficult to write into x so can you elaborate exactly why between try scenes of inverter and you could get it okay let us say it was we said that we just want to put a level restorer that is what was asked vaishnav said let us put a level restorer so uh for an inverter the level restorer would mean a feedback inverter instead of half flaps we put a full latch am i right hello have you understood this part why do i need a full inverter not just a pmos zero and one stable at x position so in a dynamic gate your output could only be zero could only go to zero yes sir so you only you always knew that if the output goes to zero then if that is when i need to or when the output remains one that is when i need to maintain the out maintain the output there yes in this case it's a latch how does this is zero and one both okay so you need to maintain both zero and once we need to put an inverter yes yes is it clear no sir now if i put an inverter what happens this let us say this was zero earlier so this will drive this at one am i right yes sir now when i turn the clock on z wants to write into this yes sir but this inverter is driving back yeah okay so b wanted so d wanted to discharge this but this inverter is also charging this up yes sir so this is a file condition hello yes sir now if we put a tri-state what happens if i put a tri-state over here what happens now so we are synchronizing the input to x appropriately so that i won't get in a condition that at a time these both get into a conflict so when this path is active this would be off look at it when phi is equal to 1 this nmos is on phi bar is equal to 0 so this pmos is also on d is trying to write to x but when phi is equal to 1 it is going to the pmos over here so this tri-state will no longer be driving yes huh so now you've removed the fighting conditions so we've actually done the level restorative stuff only just made it safer so can't it also be done by using a feedback inverter but a smaller feedback inverter so that it doesn't fight back which feedback inverter so uh we earlier drawn like that sram type cell so uh we just below this bottom inverter which is used for feedback we can size it so small that it doesn't fight back yeah but then you know about variations now yes so what can variations do variations can make you this inverter very strong so how strong i mean i am designing it to be so so small so yeah but even then what's the harm in putting it into a tri-state you are guaranteeing functionality independent of any variations you are guaranteeing functionality when you put it at high state is it not yes sir that's why so clock load would decrease i know but functionality is more important so what's the internal structure of this tri-state buffer oh you don't know the triassic buffer i i don't so tristate buffer sorry i've assumed that upload when it tries to buffer today so if i say this is input and this is output then there will be ck bar going over and ck going over here so that when ck is equal to 1 this acts as an inverter okay yes sir yes so it's just an inverter only we just clocked it yes sir so that it does not fight back the forward path when needed okay yes so i mean uh for example in the simple when we had only cascaded the inverter after the x node and i know that the x is basically my floating uh high so for example so is it i'm only concerned with the output when it is a high impedance one because then because zero to hamara zero it's good like right zero would be why why is zero good there is a there is a metal running next to this node x and it is going from zero to one it will couple a charge one on this x okay so but like is it i am considering the kind of worst case like it will uh going above or below the bdd by two positions you are a designer you cannot leave anything to chance i just gave you a failure mode you cannot think beyond that now whether circuit can fail you can no longer use it okay so you have to find another solution so so like we can't rely on the cascaded inverter to restore the kind of cascade inverter so so this inverter only like simple single inverter that we have cascade after the transmission gauge over the credit store it does not even drive if you have just one inverter on the output no feedback how will the output of the inverter restore the input you know so if it is in the if the variation is in within the noise margins then it can restore right then it can oh in the dynamic gates we looked at the dynamic gates before the system why did we look at the dynamic gates first because in dynamic dates we saw that there's nothing that can help you to restore yes yes how will what will restore over here tell me so i'm thinking for example if x is there if x is at one and it suffers commodore decay so its uh voltage will drop but if it is if the drop is within the noise margin of the inverter then how do you control it within the noise margin okay right that is the challenge yes now you cannot control it now you to control it you have to put this kind of a feedback yes yes sir okay rajneesh sir when this clock is zero sir that is when this transmission gate is off and this uh this tri-state uh feedback this turns on so any value on this uh q bar so may this x so still those advantages but this much correct and all of our operation may get so disturbed so will x and q bar not always be inverted inverted and out inverted of each other versions of each other no sir when this above latch is off and this when this below uh this tri-state buffer is on in that case haha so d is no longer driving now no sir yes b had driven x to some value yes and x had driven q to some value q bar to some value yes so q x is equal to inverter inverted off value of q bar x is already equal to that am i right yes sir but sir any glitch on this q bar may uh change this x suppose some q bar will change so that is the noise margin of a latch yes so that that is a different thing see that is the noise margin of this latch now yes so you're talking about an entirely different asset but if there is no noise then there is no problem am i right yes no noise means even if there is some noise which leads to some slight dips not a glitch and yes are you able to see the difference between a dip and a glitch uh depending glitch sir glitch will happen in q bar and deep will happen on this ex no no no no so glitch means glitch means that there is something which is some rise or fall some some transition on the signal is so large that the subsequent stage samples it as it as a change in input yes sir okay that is a glitch so that is a hazard actually what happens is qp you you you coupled so much of noise on q rising noise on q let us say that is a q bar sorry it's q bar over here you coupled so much noise on the q bar that uh x actually sends that q bar is equal to 0 and then x will go to 1 let us say yes so in that case we say that the noise margin of the latch has been corrupted yes okay but if someone is within that noise margin then the latch will restore x to 0 and q bar to 1 at all times yes which if you did not have a feedback would not have been done restoring could not have been possible yes sir one thing sir sir but when you added this buffer uh in front of transmission gate you told that there is no back driving disk and after that we added this tri-state buffer so can this queue bar affect the d at any instance possible now c now q bar will q bar will drive x through this tri-state and therefore q bar can end up driving b also if there is a situation if there is a situation where phi and phi bar they have a they have some delay between them yes so much loves are back driving the b o g w tri-state buffer or uh transmission with no except on driver yes that is why we just call it a risk we are not saying it will it will happen we are saying there is a risk it can happen or maybe it will depend upon our circuit it will depend on the timing variation between phi and fiber okay yes yes okay sir this uh basically this type of latch that you have drawn back-to-back inverter this moves in the sram cell so sir there there will kind of largely ignore this diffusion input and or and all those problems are there also i'm driving a pass gate in the sram center uh so sram cell uh is a different thing we will look at scam cell and we will cover that topic okay sram cell is never driven by a system input sram cell is always driven by something which is within your control as a circuit designer so you can always characterize it and you can always manage it so i know that what is in the proximity of the cell and what are the loads sram cell is very controlled it is used in a very controlled environment so we can use do it over there we cannot do it elsewhere okay okay so our tri-state buffer is essentially a better version of transmission gate so why are we using transmission so you can use transmission gates also yes uh no i i said uh tristate is a better version of transmission gates yeah so sorry you can use tri-state so in fact you will see that in flip

but you see this is such so much bigger than the first latch that we talked about hannah this is so much bigger than that clock load has increased so much but it is still very widely used because it is the most robust one is that okay so so i just wanted to ask for example in the complex gate designing that we're doing the if you are not considering the ptl based design logic then the diffusion

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,lY-7fT2-5ag,so wherever you are generating clock bar whether it is in the pll and then you're routing making a full clock tree for clock bar also or you're saying taking clock inside your latch and inverting it there itself and using it whatever you choose do you realize that there will be some delays [Music] okay so just like we drew the latches we can also make flip flops a flip flop is essentially a pair of back to back latches so if i did not want to go to a very stable feedback driven circuit i could have a latch which has floating gates like x or i could have a latch like this one where my outputs do not even touch or uh you know influence the inputs in whichever possible way so which which flip flop would you do you think will be most commonly used it's the bottom the lower one and because it's much more robust even though it is much bigger in size but it is more robust so we use something like this rather so in the eddy in this boat this additional inverter that i am using that is just for the functionality right so that i do not end up influencing the internal node the latch from the output okay so but like uh in the second design uh after that that uh after i've isolated the q bar i'm still adding an additional inverter that i don't need right and then i need q and q bar both see both outputs are usually there okay so those inverters are put inside the flop itself okay so the back driving issue to minimize that okay yes okay so uh now you remember we talked about clock dating where we said that to reduce dynamic power we will get some part of the circuit so that there is no clock toggling there yes so that we say power of toggling of signals so clock dating is enabled in flip flops and latches by using the use of this signal called enable when enable equal to zero any transition on clock is ignored and you can implement this system in two of the ways either by using a multiplexer or using a and or an and gate are you able to see this any questions here are you are you able to see that if clock equal to zero the output will will become independent of clock if enable equal to zero output becomes independent of clock are you able to see that yes yes sir hmm so any questions on this functionality is evident fairly evident from the slide itself okay uh in this multiplexer uh one the multiplexer thing so there don't we even x give an extra constraint of like enable should come first and d would settle and then the clock comes i mean the enable and d will also have some because the enable is not clock enable is a signal so those regular signals give each one you don't put constraints block and enable yes there is a constraint clock and data there will be a constraint but not not between data and enable that is considered to be combination alone yeah anna yes okay can you elaborate to the candle habit on this point uh clock gate increase in setup skew i mean how is the skew it getting affected how is the skew getting marked are we actually just just keep this with process when we will talk about the timing you will see what skew is okay i have not even introduced the term skew to you know yes sir just park it somewhere you will see how it rescue will get impacted it will be evident to you okay and so in the multiplexer based design then my enable is say zero i mean how is the clock uh i'm like isolating from the clock when with the enable signal that i was not able to clear so the latch is not changing uh or not going to dina d will not reflect on q until enable is zero because the input of the latch remains constant which is equal to the output then enable equal to zero what path gets activated in the multiplexer design so that d1 enable equal to zero okay okay yes yes zero yes equal to zero means this path is activated so any change in d will not come into picture okay okay okay same here you see yes it is yeah that was asked okay great so now in addition to enable signals you will see that flip flops also sometimes have what is called as a reset signal what does reset mean reset means that the output will be pushed to zero output will be pushed to low when reset is asserted and it could be synchronous or asynchronous the first implementation is synchronous one where output will be pushed to zero at the next rising edge of the clock or whenever the clock is high again this one on the other hand is an asynchronous reset whereby using reset on additional gates inside the latches i have ensured that uh as soon as reset comes my output will be 0. are you able to see this why do you think this reset pin is even necessary or maybe while putting my circuit into sleep or getting getting some part of circuit i want to bring it to a suppose power up power up is happening a powerhop has just happened and now you want to say that okay i want to start with a clean slate during power up some latches will be zero some latches will be one i have no control over anything i know some latches could be zero some so i just assert reset all the flops everything is zero now now it is the deterministic state that i am starting from so what is power up okay like on off yeah okay okay okay now when you do this power up do you really want all blocks to be zero or there could be some flops because of the state machine requirements you may want them to be one also it can happen so that is what takes us to the next kind of a flip flop which is set reset flip flop where if you want to set then something would happen if you want to reset something else would happen so in this case what you do you are able to create the state machine that you desire you obviously notice there are many more transistors in this flop now there is this has and all the inverters are converted into two input gates at least if not more i know it's a tristated gate fan this has many more transistors now but if you need this functionality in a few flops you will use the set reset flops at those places at other places where the they are not a part of the fsm of the system or anything like that you may still use the regular reset flops or the regular flops also without even reset but some flops in the fsm you may want to use set reset flops so that you can power up in a desired state machine and then therefore give faster output to the user or whatever faster better experience to the user so you'll lose some area but you will have a deterministic power up by using the set reset flop okay any questions so sir like with this set and reset i'm just trying i'm trying to control the internal states of the flip flop like irrespective output yes sir like uh it is uh apart from the uh normal computation that exactly i mean yeah i'm not even waiting for clock to arrive i'm saying let me change the output even before clock arrives so but the clock uh only when it is asynchronous then only i will be able to control otherwise the synchronous clock has to arrive right yeah in this case set reset is usually a synchronous okay set preset both are used with asynchronous only usually when it is only reset you can think of synchronous and asynchronous but set reset flop people understand it is for the state machine so the clock may not even be coming at that time okay because you're talking about power ups i know the clock may not be active yet even then i may want to have a state machine of my choice yes sir okay anything else so in the state machine like why is the need of setting this up actually okay uh how do i put it there could be a state machine for example let us say the there is a state machine that controls the configuration inputs of the memory okay now for memory some inputs are expected to be held at one and some other inputs are expected to be powered up at zero okay so you need some signals to be powered up at one another yes so okay okay that is why so now you may say thing that i may use an inverter but if the power up has not completely happened if the power up has not completely happened then a synchronous set reset will still work i will just power up the system in the right way uh even before uh clock first clock arrives and things like that yes sir so now we in in the in the few slides back we saw that there is this process possibility of an overlap between clk and clk bar which can lead to back gate driving and all that stuff you remember then to avoid that or what did you do we added inverters extra inverters on the outputs and everything so by using this true single phase clock flip flops i can avoid that altogether this is called tspc true single phase clock flops here what has happened is here uh you will notice that i am able to hold the data or make it as a latch by using only one phase of clock the risk is that this internal node intermediate node is dynamic in nature now so tspc flops are much faster are smaller have lesser risk of ckck bar overlaps because there is only ck now but there is a risk of this intermediate node struggling because of noise issues okay so this looks like a dynamic gate for a clock yeah that is why i said no this is the risk the node is floating there so now if you want to include logic in tspc you can also include logic into tspc latches but again always remember this is a risk there will be floating nodes somewhere or the other if both in and uh in n1 and n2 are one if both n1 and n2 are one then what happens and and let us say ck is also is equal to zero then what happens this node is floating are you able to see this so the output will be tentative we do not know this is a risky kind of a design so see dynamic circuits without level restorers without all those checks in place can be very risky pspc and therefore will not be used in places where noise immunity is is considered to be a very high criteria huh wherever speed is very highly required or something like that you could still use dsbc yes so can you please elaborate exactly what exactly are we solving the problem with this tspc i was not able to get so there was a you remember there was this tri-state and we said there is we said there was a possibility of q back driving d when ck and ck bar overlap yes sir so and and to avoid this then we added inverters here and we did so many things yes sir now we say that is there a way to avoid extra gates save area and that is what pspc is solving here only ck is being used okay so i'm doing this to avoid the back driving yeah okay okay however notice that this means that this node is now floating it comes with a risk so use it only very very carefully in a very very controlled environment not anywhere else okay similarly we have a tspcc flip flop also so yes so by default what design do we use by default what design do we use the static the one that i showed with so many extra transistors okay it's the one now without enabling usually used enable one is also required at some places and then you also require set and uh and set reset flops at some places but majority of the times the regular flop will be used without enable and without set reset okay uh and so so they they both need clock and drop pass in this but by default whenever we see some synthesized net list we only see one clock in any flip flop or another generated inside am saying that consistently the clock transistor is uh nearer to the output node um clock transistor is nearer to the output node only so that unnecessary toggling on d for example should not lead to noise on x activity factor is the highest so shouldn't it be isolated instead of d for the question i mean why you were taking that what he asked okay let us look at the other way around let us say clock was on the other side clock was on the top and d was coming to the what do you say inverter kind of a thing directly what would happen okay so i mean if it is coming on the top then the d would be coming here so if these i'm considering that the okay but if it's flip flop i know that key it is uh h triggered so but d if it coming so at the edge of the clock only my t can be impact my x node but if it comes in the middle if d comes closer to x then what happens it can it can do something even when it is o even when the edge is not triggered then also it can impact the expert okay yes we don't want that yes so we are giving this sensitivity much precise towards the clock right sir so that uh as friends let's not do these hypothetical experiments you just draw the circuit and check for the functionality now yes sir so but sir even if i push this clock transistor above the d p mass even then the vdd will not be connected to the x uh even if the d is making some spurious movements so it does not really affect the output node in the either case right because that path has to be on yes that path has to be on but uh again i would say you you just experiment make the circuit with the clock on the top and be in the center and you will see what happens i want you to do this exercise also yes yes yeah sir i just wanted to say one thing sir so if my clock is at the top and my d is at the bottom so there might be a parasitic capacitance between so in that position uh when there is a glitch on my d then there is a possibility that my output might get discharged yeah yeah so glitches attract all those things dynamic gates because you will see that problem would exist even here now yes sir yeah okay let's see so anyways i'm not going to spend too much time on tspc because i just wanted to introduce,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY-7fT2-5ag,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY-7fT2-5ag
Transcript: so wherever you are generating clock bar whether it is in the pll and then you're routing making a full clock tree for clock bar also or you're saying taking clock inside your latch and inverting it there itself and using it whatever you choose do you realize that there will be some delays [Music] okay so just like we drew the latches we can also make flip flops a flip flop is essentially a pair of back to back latches so if i did not want to go to a very stable feedback driven circuit i could have a latch which has floating gates like x or i could have a latch like this one where my outputs do not even touch or uh you know influence the inputs in whichever possible way so which which flip flop would you do you think will be most commonly used it's the bottom the lower one and because it's much more robust even though it is much bigger in size but it is more robust so we use something like this rather so in the eddy in this boat this additional inverter that i am using that is just for the functionality right so that i do not end up influencing the internal node the latch from the output okay so but like uh in the second design uh after that that uh after i've isolated the q bar i'm still adding an additional inverter that i don't need right and then i need q and q bar both see both outputs are usually there okay so those inverters are put inside the flop itself okay so the back driving issue to minimize that okay yes okay so uh now you remember we talked about clock dating where we said that to reduce dynamic power we will get some part of the circuit so that there is no clock toggling there yes so that we say power of toggling of signals so clock dating is enabled in flip flops and latches by using the use of this signal called enable when enable equal to zero any transition on clock is ignored and you can implement this system in two of the ways either by using a multiplexer or using a and or an and gate are you able to see this any questions here are you are you able to see that if clock equal to zero the output will will become independent of clock if enable equal to zero output becomes independent of clock are you able to see that yes yes sir hmm so any questions on this functionality is evident fairly evident from the slide itself okay uh in this multiplexer uh one the multiplexer thing so there don't we even x give an extra constraint of like enable should come first and d would settle and then the clock comes i mean the enable and d will also have some because the enable is not clock enable is a signal so those regular signals give each one you don't put constraints block and enable yes there is a constraint clock and data there will be a constraint but not not between data and enable that is considered to be combination alone yeah anna yes okay can you elaborate to the candle habit on this point uh clock gate increase in setup skew i mean how is the skew it getting affected how is the skew getting marked are we actually just just keep this with process when we will talk about the timing you will see what skew is okay i have not even introduced the term skew to you know yes sir just park it somewhere you will see how it rescue will get impacted it will be evident to you okay and so in the multiplexer based design then my enable is say zero i mean how is the clock uh i'm like isolating from the clock when with the enable signal that i was not able to clear so the latch is not changing uh or not going to dina d will not reflect on q until enable is zero because the input of the latch remains constant which is equal to the output then enable equal to zero what path gets activated in the multiplexer design so that d1 enable equal to zero okay okay yes yes zero yes equal to zero means this path is activated so any change in d will not come into picture okay okay okay same here you see yes it is yeah that was asked okay great so now in addition to enable signals you will see that flip flops also sometimes have what is called as a reset signal what does reset mean reset means that the output will be pushed to zero output will be pushed to low when reset is asserted and it could be synchronous or asynchronous the first implementation is synchronous one where output will be pushed to zero at the next rising edge of the clock or whenever the clock is high again this one on the other hand is an asynchronous reset whereby using reset on additional gates inside the latches i have ensured that uh as soon as reset comes my output will be 0. are you able to see this why do you think this reset pin is even necessary or maybe while putting my circuit into sleep or getting getting some part of circuit i want to bring it to a suppose power up power up is happening a powerhop has just happened and now you want to say that okay i want to start with a clean slate during power up some latches will be zero some latches will be one i have no control over anything i know some latches could be zero some so i just assert reset all the flops everything is zero now now it is the deterministic state that i am starting from so what is power up okay like on off yeah okay okay okay now when you do this power up do you really want all blocks to be zero or there could be some flops because of the state machine requirements you may want them to be one also it can happen so that is what takes us to the next kind of a flip flop which is set reset flip flop where if you want to set then something would happen if you want to reset something else would happen so in this case what you do you are able to create the state machine that you desire you obviously notice there are many more transistors in this flop now there is this has and all the inverters are converted into two input gates at least if not more i know it's a tristated gate fan this has many more transistors now but if you need this functionality in a few flops you will use the set reset flops at those places at other places where the they are not a part of the fsm of the system or anything like that you may still use the regular reset flops or the regular flops also without even reset but some flops in the fsm you may want to use set reset flops so that you can power up in a desired state machine and then therefore give faster output to the user or whatever faster better experience to the user so you'll lose some area but you will have a deterministic power up by using the set reset flop okay any questions so sir like with this set and reset i'm just trying i'm trying to control the internal states of the flip flop like irrespective output yes sir like uh it is uh apart from the uh normal computation that exactly i mean yeah i'm not even waiting for clock to arrive i'm saying let me change the output even before clock arrives so but the clock uh only when it is asynchronous then only i will be able to control otherwise the synchronous clock has to arrive right yeah in this case set reset is usually a synchronous okay set preset both are used with asynchronous only usually when it is only reset you can think of synchronous and asynchronous but set reset flop people understand it is for the state machine so the clock may not even be coming at that time okay because you're talking about power ups i know the clock may not be active yet even then i may want to have a state machine of my choice yes sir okay anything else so in the state machine like why is the need of setting this up actually okay uh how do i put it there could be a state machine for example let us say the there is a state machine that controls the configuration inputs of the memory okay now for memory some inputs are expected to be held at one and some other inputs are expected to be powered up at zero okay so you need some signals to be powered up at one another yes so okay okay that is why so now you may say thing that i may use an inverter but if the power up has not completely happened if the power up has not completely happened then a synchronous set reset will still work i will just power up the system in the right way uh even before uh clock first clock arrives and things like that yes sir so now we in in the in the few slides back we saw that there is this process possibility of an overlap between clk and clk bar which can lead to back gate driving and all that stuff you remember then to avoid that or what did you do we added inverters extra inverters on the outputs and everything so by using this true single phase clock flip flops i can avoid that altogether this is called tspc true single phase clock flops here what has happened is here uh you will notice that i am able to hold the data or make it as a latch by using only one phase of clock the risk is that this internal node intermediate node is dynamic in nature now so tspc flops are much faster are smaller have lesser risk of ckck bar overlaps because there is only ck now but there is a risk of this intermediate node struggling because of noise issues okay so this looks like a dynamic gate for a clock yeah that is why i said no this is the risk the node is floating there so now if you want to include logic in tspc you can also include logic into tspc latches but again always remember this is a risk there will be floating nodes somewhere or the other if both in and uh in n1 and n2 are one if both n1 and n2 are one then what happens and and let us say ck is also is equal to zero then what happens this node is floating are you able to see this so the output will be tentative we do not know this is a risky kind of a design so see dynamic circuits without level restorers without all those checks in place can be very risky pspc and therefore will not be used in places where noise immunity is is considered to be a very high criteria huh wherever speed is very highly required or something like that you could still use dsbc yes so can you please elaborate exactly what exactly are we solving the problem with this tspc i was not able to get so there was a you remember there was this tri-state and we said there is we said there was a possibility of q back driving d when ck and ck bar overlap yes sir so and and to avoid this then we added inverters here and we did so many things yes sir now we say that is there a way to avoid extra gates save area and that is what pspc is solving here only ck is being used okay so i'm doing this to avoid the back driving yeah okay okay however notice that this means that this node is now floating it comes with a risk so use it only very very carefully in a very very controlled environment not anywhere else okay similarly we have a tspcc flip flop also so yes so by default what design do we use by default what design do we use the static the one that i showed with so many extra transistors okay it's the one now without enabling usually used enable one is also required at some places and then you also require set and uh and set reset flops at some places but majority of the times the regular flop will be used without enable and without set reset okay uh and so so they they both need clock and drop pass in this but by default whenever we see some synthesized net list we only see one clock in any flip flop or another generated inside am saying that consistently the clock transistor is uh nearer to the output node um clock transistor is nearer to the output node only so that unnecessary toggling on d for example should not lead to noise on x activity factor is the highest so shouldn't it be isolated instead of d for the question i mean why you were taking that what he asked okay let us look at the other way around let us say clock was on the other side clock was on the top and d was coming to the what do you say inverter kind of a thing directly what would happen okay so i mean if it is coming on the top then the d would be coming here so if these i'm considering that the okay but if it's flip flop i know that key it is uh h triggered so but d if it coming so at the edge of the clock only my t can be impact my x node but if it comes in the middle if d comes closer to x then what happens it can it can do something even when it is o even when the edge is not triggered then also it can impact the expert okay yes we don't want that yes so we are giving this sensitivity much precise towards the clock right sir so that uh as friends let's not do these hypothetical experiments you just draw the circuit and check for the functionality now yes sir so but sir even if i push this clock transistor above the d p mass even then the vdd will not be connected to the x uh even if the d is making some spurious movements so it does not really affect the output node in the either case right because that path has to be on yes that path has to be on but uh again i would say you you just experiment make the circuit with the clock on the top and be in the center and you will see what happens i want you to do this exercise also yes yes yeah sir i just wanted to say one thing sir so if my clock is at the top and my d is at the bottom so there might be a parasitic capacitance between so in that position uh when there is a glitch on my d then there is a possibility that my output might get discharged yeah yeah so glitches attract all those things dynamic gates because you will see that problem would exist even here now yes sir yeah okay let's see so anyways i'm not going to spend too much time on tspc because i just wanted to introduce"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,JcweW0X0CC0,it to you not too much time on it because you know there are other designs also for example c2 moss where you have this uh what do you say this kind of a design where even if now you have both phases of clock over here clk and clk bar both exist over here but what happens uh at any given point of time even if one side goes active the other side will not drive so even in in the case of a zero zero overlap or a one one overlap even in the case of overlaps you will see that your design is safe okay again uh this over here also this x node is is uh many times floating not really a very stable state to be in so even c2 mass designs you will not see you will not find to be used at many many places but yes where there is a very high requirement for density and also this risk of clock clock bar overlap you can you can think of using this kind of a c2 moss design also and then you will have to use keepers you know as is already said you will have to use keepers and all those things will need to be done okay this is also a dynamic design so while these are solutions you will notice they are not very commonly used because of the very nature that there are floating nodes there and with floating nodes the biggest problem is on a flop or a sequencing element if you use floating nodes the overall robustness of the entire system can get compromised so they are not very commonly used but they are proposals their ideas which you just need to be aware of so yes cspc and c2 mass are both parallel solutions to the bad drive problem right not yeah there is no advantage over c2 mos over tspc right no no yes okay uh yeah now we come to timings i think let's start with this in the next class the timings of of uh timings related to a large and a flop we'll start with the next class then we will see okay yes so great yes so uh certain digital circuits we we uh we studied a very different design of flip flop and matches in that we progressed very uniformly from an sr batch then we added enable signal then we created a latch then we created master slave to make a flip flop d flip flop so and then we also saw a design of d flip flop which consisted of mini and the gates and case not gates so which was not even master slave it was just a single d flip flop so do we even make those designs so we make the designs that we just saw so we want to keep it as simple as possible and as dense as possible yes so this is how we would use it as dense as possible so even the densest one that we looked at today which was the one that just let me go back to that side the ones that we looked at with uh set reset or isabella you see this one itself is such a big problem is it not it's nowhere near what we were talking about [Music] yeah but look at it the digital circuit one is something like this because digital circuit one you did all set reset also from outside now because it started from sr latch yes so digital circuit one look like this probably anna yes yeah because you started from sr latch yes over here what we are saying is that set reset functionality is not required in all the flops so why waste area yes in vlsi area is this okay yes great so uh we we'll close the class now there were some project related doubts you can ask them yes sir sir i was asking that if we look at the layout aspect then c-square mos looks like very very good design that yes it could be so could we like to some and do a trade-off and go for it and like make two keepers and then implement the c square mass instead of this will be pseudostatic again they realize this there will still be some risk some robustness so people use it anyways that is why everyone touched upon it otherwise touching use it but it's very rarely used in very very specific cases someone would use that kind of a plot okay yes sir we had some project related doubts so basically we are comparing the complex and non-complex implementation of aoi 221 so in that set we simply created the two net list and try to verify that whether the delays decrease in the non-complex implementation also we did the theoretical calculations so for by the theoretical calculation and more delay and all so we were able to uh expect we expected that the delay would decrease but opposite of that is happening we are we are getting more delays in the non-complex one okay so anyways finally you would get better delays with the complex implementation because of uh lesser wires and more density and everything but i'm surprised that uh even when you are not talking about the layouts and not talking about those parasites even then you are able to see that of a complex gate would be slightly higher though it is much denser but the effect would be visible largely only after extraction so i'm surprised you're able to see it before extraction also is a class value experiment measure there was a thing that you you had put out inverter after the aoi and then also you remove the two inverters that could have come in the other logic so that that was kind of a natural thing to reduce the delay of the non-complex implementation of uh we need that functionality but you make it from the basic gates we are calling it and or invert that doesn't mean that you have to use an and gate and an or gate and an inverter no no no that is the functionality yes sir okay okay do the bubble pushing get to the densest implementation you will see it is uh it should be slightly faster non-complex should be faster right yeah non-complex should be slightly faster on fab on on simulation first simulation but after layout you will see that complex one will be much faster so in the pre-simulation we are getting that [Music] it's good if it is faster but the point is that the theoretical calculations and the simulations are not agreeing with each other that's the problem so probably i'm justifying you okay because in the theoretical calculations also you have ignored so many capacities simulation has taken care of all the device capacitances including source drain and miller capacitance and so many things the simulation would take care of that's also fine but i was not expecting it to already show it to you so suppose uh if we have done the layout of the complex and the non-complex then my non-complex layout will be fast should be faster or no okay because of the parasitics addition yeah yeah i was not expecting that parasitics in the non-complex gate would already be so high that it will be slower than the complex gate i was not expecting this but if it is happening it is happening it's fine okay so like can i say that uh the non-complex and the complex uh the differences between the two that with the complex we are not able to achieve the better area but also better delays yeah so the complex gates give you better delays and also better area more density and also the leakage would be better because yeah yeah okay okay that is why these are used so commonly okay so on all kind of parameters ppa i'm getting better complex okay over the nonprofits right now sir yes sir sir so when i was making the layout of non-complex get implementation sir so uh i tried it sir and for routing purposes can we use clock for routines sorry uh poly for routing no avoid that uh poly for routing within the cell it is fine but yeah within the cell it is okay 65 nanometer may i allow you but realize that in 45 onwards poly routing is not allowed so then uh we should definitely go to whenever seeing the constraints i made it without m2 layer usage so without empty layer research uh i i ran a quality down and above above for the clock and uh another one kind of connection which is is you are putting a large r on the clock path you're adding lots of more delays there sir but uh i am covering it with an pp layer doesn't that no even then it is resistive no it is bound to be more resistant than a metal is it not yes yes yeah that is what you should remember it is always more resistant than copper okay sir so sir then uh can we use m2 layer for that sir just for clock in case no not for clock only for routing clock so you're using dynamic gates yeah dynamic and non-complexing so interconnecting clock between different dynamic gates you can use metal tool interconnecting signals across different gates you can use metal to for every gate independently there should be no metal to usage okay okay yes sir okay circuit a and circuit b if circuit a has a high rise time and circuit b has lower high rise time so sir if i ask about the rise propagation delay then i will expect the circuit a to have a correspondingly high high rise delay also and other one would have the lower so basically this should kind of correlate according to what i think but but in the uh simulation that we ran uh at that point of time we were able to see that it was not the case for the circuit where rise time was higher the rise propagation delay was lower so it should not kind of this is very counter intuitive to me no there are if there is a path that you're talking about and there are two or three stages that a signal is moving from input to output then it could be that the the the design is skewed in such a way that the propagation delay moves differently than uh we will be differently for rise and fall and uh the final stage the rise time and fall time is largely dependent on the load versus the drive strength of the pmos and the nmos in the output stage so they are actually independent things okay okay so i am comparing the input slew of the first stage so i should compare the input slope last season should have a similar trend no that is what i am saying no yes so i'm not able to get that why why not if i'm white that should not be the case i mean so let us say you have this chain now what did you do you high skewed it you low skewed it you high skewed it and you let us say made this as a balanced one so what will happen the higher transition zero to one transition will be fast yes one two zero will be fast zero to one will be very fast so the is a fall transition here that will happen the delay will be much shorter huh but in this particular gate since it is only balanced my rise time and fall time are exactly the same so the delays are different but the rise time and fall time are same are you able to see that yes okay yes sir i know if you are talking only of one gate then whatever assumptions you are making could be correct but that is don't build such correlations which can hamper your overall if i have not told you that correlation it may not exist or if it exists then yes it is good to validate so for example in this case both were same the rise time the fourth time was same and the delays were different could be different so but for example if my rice time is improving so my rice delay should also be improving right you see example what did i say i said high low high so high rising faster falling faster rising faster yes sir so what happened because the rising was the the see in three inverters in three inverters the falling delay of this particular gate was preferred so the even though it is a high skewed inverter the following delay will be lesser for this entire path than the rising delay but this is a high skewed inverter so the rise time will be much better than the fault time okay yeah the delays are getting him affected by the previous stages also what kind of that yes yes okay but the rise the thai rice name for timer because of of that stage only itself okay primarily yes primarily yes okay so always think of the failure case if you try to if you're making an assumption you should not look at examples which justify your assumption you should try to find examples which violate your uh your assumption okay yes yes this is called failure mode analysis and good designer should always be able to do very well on the failure mode analysis path okay yes question if your hand is raised you want to ask something else question sir yeah sir so uh i'll i can use m24 clock and they are they are of different stages uh obviously uh so i can use m2 for uh clock and uh for routing purpose between different cssr i can use uh poly right between different stages you only use metal okay okay so so can i use them nice you can use metal one but you cannot use poly okay so can i use m2 twicer in my circuit yes okay okay sir thank you thank you it should not short no no they should be clean otherwise you use them to twice try forever times you use okay but use of m2 should only to interconnect gates not in within the gate okay yes yes yeah of enough flip flop because you will have to generate block bar from and within your flip flop enough okay you will get only clock pin focus you have to put an inverter there yourself,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcweW0X0CC0,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcweW0X0CC0

mean so let us say you have this chain now what did you do you high skewed it you low skewed it you high skewed it and you let us say made this as a balanced one so what will happen the higher transition zero to one transition will be fast yes one two zero will be fast zero to one will be very fast so the is a fall transition here that will happen the delay will be much shorter huh but in this particular gate since it is only balanced my rise time and fall time are exactly the same so the delays are different but the rise time and fall time are same are you able to see that yes okay yes sir i know if you are talking only of one gate then whatever assumptions you are making could be correct but that is don't build such correlations which can hamper your overall if i have not told you that correlation it may not exist or if it exists then yes it is good to validate so for example in this case both were same the rise time the fourth time was same and the delays were different could be different so but for example if my rice time is improving so my rice delay should also be improving right you see example what did i say i said high low high so high rising faster falling faster rising faster yes sir so what happened because the rising was the the see in three inverters in three inverters the falling delay of this particular gate was preferred so the even though it is a high skewed inverter the following delay will be lesser for this entire path than the rising delay but this is a high skewed inverter so the rise time will be much better than the fault time okay yeah the delays are getting him affected by the previous stages also what kind of that yes yes okay but the rise the thai rice name for timer because of of that stage only itself okay primarily yes primarily yes okay so always think of the failure case if you try to if you're making an assumption you should not look at examples which justify your assumption you should try to find examples which violate your uh your assumption okay yes yes this is called failure mode analysis and good designer should always be able to do very well on the failure mode analysis path okay yes question if your hand is raised you want to ask something else question sir yeah sir so uh i'll i can use m24 clock and they are they are of different stages uh obviously uh so i can use m2 for uh clock and uh for routing purpose between different cssr i can use uh poly right between different stages you only use metal okay okay so so can i use them nice you can use metal one but you cannot use poly okay so can i use m2 twicer in my circuit yes okay okay sir thank you thank you it should not short no no they should be clean otherwise you use them to twice try forever times you use okay but use of m2 should only to interconnect gates not in within the gate okay yes yes yeah of enough flip flop because you will have to generate block bar from and within your flip flop enough okay you will get only clock pin focus you have to put an inverter there yourself"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,neIUfuFfWUg,okay sir thank you okay anything else great so then when we say that there is this flop edge or something like that then do you realize that we are also talking about some sampling that is happening when we say a flip flop is edge triggered so at an edge if a flop becomes transparent what essentially we are saying is it is sampling the data input at that edge whether it is rising edge or falling is depending on my flip flop design i am sampling it at that place am i right yes sir so if a if a flip flop i say would sample is a it's a positive edge triggered flip flop and it is sampling data at the rising edge of the clock and then now let us consider a flip a latch a positive level triggered latch what would be the sampling edge of a positive edge triggered latch where would it sample its data that's a positive level triggered positive level trigger latch where with yes on the following days of the clock because uh it starts to become opaque after that okay so now uh what is important to realize it that is that to be able to sample correctly there are some timings that need to be met see the delay the delay the kind of timing you already know am i right that the input to output delay propagation delay contamination delay all these timings we've already discussed in much detail when we started with the combination of circuits in fact much earlier with the logical effort stuff you remember that yes sir now when it comes to flip flops and latches we also have this additional feature of a sampling edge and income in with respect to this sampling edge there needs to be some timings that need to be designed that need to be taken care of okay so today we will look at these timing parameters and how they need to be qualified when we design our systems okay so this is a latch a latch would have one timing which is linked to minimum pulse widths then just abraham curry that at the falling edge of the there will be a sampling like the following edge of the clock is the sampling edge so we have hold and setup time definitions at the following edge of the clock so what does hold time mean and what does setup time mean the minimum amount of time for which the data has to be held at the deep end of the latch after the sampling has arrived that is a whole time and before uh so it should settle before set up time yeah so is is is this definition clear almost the exact definition so why is the survive the sampling edge this uh i'm not able to get the sampling edge thing uh in this for the latch okay so abhi we started with this thing that if it's a positive level triggered latch then during the positive pulse period uh it will be transparent yes sir during the negative pulse period it will be opaque yes yes sir so when it goes opaque what is it sampling what is it showing as the output uh what it has sampled in the positive period of the clock period so it may have sampled multiple rise and falls but what will it show in the in the low period uh success by sampling your mean just transparent for example if it was d was like this okay huh but q would have also have been like this yes sir hannah so what did it sample and where did it sample it now uh the last value would have been it has sampled last value to here has it sampled this um so actually in this figure it is the same actually it is constant throughout the period for the i have look at the red curve that okay so no it has it has not sampled it has sampled the red one the last red one it seems so then what does it mean that whatever was valid at the falling edge of the clock that is what is sampled and maintained for the entire negative edge duration negative level duration am i right yes yes sir that is why we are calling this negative as the sampling edge so by but sampling you just mean that it is taking that value yes it will no longer accept any other changes it has sampled it now it will hold it for the negative for the for the opaque duration okay okay uh okay so so like the last value that will be basically enlarged finally lash that becomes my sampling edge so the uh till the time my data is changing and my clock is one yeah nothing is getting latched yes lasting actually happens only on this edge in the low period when the system becomes opaque is it not so yeah are you able to see this yes so that value it will be helding basically that is yeah whatever value it holds that is what the latch is otherwise so it's transparent so it's not a latch it is operating like a combinational circuit okay are we able to see this yes so so we will be considering therefore we say that falling that is the sampling edge okay so so we are considering that edge of the clock from where the latching operation basically begins yes okay that is the sampling edge because that is what latched okay now the time the duration for which the input this data should be stable before the sampling edge arrives that time is referred to as setup time okay and after the sampling guide has arrived data needs to be held for some more time that time is called the hold time are you able to see this sir so effectively can we say that for both the positive level trigger latch and the negative edge triggered flip flop the sampling edge would be the same and the setup and all time constraints would be the same positive level trigger latch and negative edge triggered flip-flop yes that is what we are saying now that for the positive level triggered latch negative edge of the clock is the sampling edge yes yes exactly yes okay um so is this concept clear because i see many students get confused uh you know whatever is written in the books is not very clear whatever is being taught in many colleges across the country that is also very jumbled up so this concept should be actually very clear to all of you is this clear about the sampling edge and that the setup and hold times are defined from the sampling edge is this part clear so please reiterate the definitions of t hold and t setup so t setup is the minimum duration for which the inputs should be held stable before the sampling edge arrives yes p hold is the minimum duration for which the inputs should be again held stable after the sampling edge has arrived okay okay thank you okay rather you have a question hand is raised yes sir actually uh can the sampling edge with respect to this i'm clear so but for example when the clock period goes if i'm in the clock becomes high for the first time so my latch is getting transparent from that moment on so in this case will i call this the falling edge of the clock only the sampling edge or both the rising and the following one the sampling edge i mean because uh how what what exactly doing the samplings are actually mean like is it transparent when it's becoming transparent or like that that terminology is getting me confused so what do you understand by sampling we have looked at two or three examples just now what do you capture about sam what do you understand about sampling so then i will collect that definition if there is something wrong so to me it seems that if the any changes in the input or the d pin if it is if the if my flop is able to capture that so that cross that thing that basically that that is called uh to me sampling that is no exactly okay sampling edge that is what my question is what according to is the sampling edge sampling to ticket sampling it's say you know these timings hold and set up timings are defined from the sampling edge so what does sampling gauge according to you sampling definition you're saying is fine okay so what is sampling edge so because uh i'm here to me a sampling edge should mean that from where the sampling is starting phenomena starting or ending i mean both should be considered as sampling edges but here we are considering the following one as the sampling edge so that is inflation so i mean we're not saying following one has a sampling edge we are saying wherever the latching action now begins okay that is the sampling edge because now that value has been sampled and it will be held for a extended duration let the input change it will not reflect on the output okay so so for the clock so only one edge would be the sampling edge in any for the lattice flip flop in any case sequential elements would typically use one sampling age only one sampling edge only basically from where the latching action begins that is my sampling edge yes okay so there are double edge triggered flip flops also over there you will see you know when you look at the literature you will find some reference to double as triggered uh flip flops they are essentially uh using both edges of the clock for sampling so they are essentially giving half the pulse period for evaluations yes yes okay um sir uh we realized that the latching action takes place in the negative level of the clock then so i can really uh make a clock i can make a pulse generator rather than a clock and it can behave like a flip flop in that case very very small uh spikes off those are called false lashes we'll look at them in a little bit okay rather you have anything else to ask your hand is still raised thank you sir okay so now that we've looked at setup and hold timings what do you think these timings the tcp cq and tcp dq represent clock to queue and data to queue delays yes so what we are saying is if you take if you look at it carefully what we are saying is that if the data was already there and clock arrived later then we are saying the timing is pcq and if the data change happens when the sampling when the uh when the sequence latch was still transparent then the d2q delay then the d2q delay is called tdq okay so yes so here the d2q i think i'm able to get it why we are taking that so but why we are taking that clock to queue i mean because if the data was already settled for example before the sampling edge came suppose data was settled here something like this so what happens the the latch will continue to be opaque in this duration because it is the following it is the low level of the block of the clock yes sir so once it starts to become transparent let's come to this edge now once it starts to become transparent after the clock edge comes when it starts to become transparent there will still be some delay when this data will start to become visible on the output okay so but that delay is called tc this can be different from tdq that is why there are two different definitions there are two different labels there okay so so like it is like uh what edge what basically signal is kind of triggering my change in output yes so but for example even for example say d is causing some change or it's a clock pigment causing change but i know the implementation of the flip flop with the latches it will be following the same path so how can these two different be different delays be different then i mean oh are they really following the same path so let us say this is d and [Music] this is ck and do you think it is following the same path d is going from here ck is going from here are you able to see this so but this clock to queue path actually is not the uh i mean this is not the some i mean input we talk of them in propagation delay in terms of the signals right the input and the output yeah so ck is also one of the inputs to the latch now so but there isn't like exactly a uh exact path i can say that between like clock two d ck if there is a path from d to q then there is a path from c k root to also it is also a different path that's a different path that's it okay is it not,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neIUfuFfWUg,"Link:

also one of the inputs to the latch now so but there isn't like exactly a uh exact path i can say that between like clock two d ck if there is a path from d to q then there is a path from c k root to also it is also a different path that's a different path that's it okay is it not"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,uNg8dIZD0zQ,yes sir yeah now it's clear so that is where we have two different timing definitions for d2q and ck2q ah so are these are these timing see i'm spending quite a bit of time on these spamming definitions because they are important these are the kind of questions that will typically be asked in your interviews also yes so uh once you go back please reflect on these timing definitions you will watch need to watch the video again but it is important that you get sufficient clarity on it if you have further questions you can ask the tas ask to ask me to me in the office hours but get sufficient clarity on these aspects okay now we come to the timing parameters for the flip flop do you see some change from earlier what all has changed for the flip flop versus large spamming diagram sampling edge has changed and also now d2q is not there d2q is not there okay and sampling adjustment something that happens we are defining setup and hold on the same edge like it can be different in that yes setup and holder always defined from the sampling edge only yes is the key change is that now you do not have d2q kind of timing because flip flop is not level transparent it's not transparent during at a level it is it just samples at the clock edge okay so very simple we have this instead of t pulse width now we have a timing called t t which is cycle time or period so equity pulse width is no longer there other thing is that t dq is no longer there the perfect is replaced by something called as p period and tdq is simply not there because changes in d will not be reflected anyways they will not be reflected on queue are you able to see this any questions so in my uh previous question only so the clock to queue so for example if i'm in here for example this case uh the flip flop if i take the like transmission gate that implementation in which you had transmission gate and the inverters kind of at low uh feedback so some might exact the path between there is a path between the d2 like uh output i mean the input would flow from the d plane and ultimately they get finally latched to this uh q pin but exactly the clock to queue path i cannot say that exactly there is a clock to queue path i mean are you talking about the flip flop are the lats flip flops are here okay so let's draw the flip flop what are we talking about we have what do you say and in fact we saw that okay there could be q and q bar that are driven like this hello you remember that yes so now you are saying that there is no path from clock to queue but there is a path from d to q so i mean that uh internally with the clock this actually this path is actually i'm really interested in how how much delay for example if i do some changes in my inputs and how for half after how much delay there that input change will be reflected in my output so effectively i should be considering this deep into and q pin right the path between them because clock inputs are not using an input now clock is also an input now yes yes but that input uh i get that but that input is not getting reflected right that is basically controlling the let us say clock was zero yes the clock was zero d could only come till here it came here and it settled here now and put in d the change in d was not reflected on q yes so you cannot have a d to q timing okay okay so this clock is one whether clock is zero whatever it was change in d will not be reflected on q are you with me yes sir yes now let us say a clock toggles what happens now when clock toggles this tri-state also turns active and whatever was stable here is now starting to reflect on q so what has triggered this transition on q is it change in d or is it change in c k there's a change in ck okay that is why the timing is defined from ck to cube okay okay okay so okay i mean what exactly is a triggering edge triggering signal that from where we calculate the delays okay yes okay so okay david you see sir does clock to queue delay depend on the amount of whole time that is sharing i mean suppose you you have told me to uh reduce the profit q delay and my whole time i am not able to do video then uh how do i find it the clock can clock the queue delay be less than whole time it depends how you how your data path how long your data path is and so on so it depends yes it can be done like that that whole time is really very very large but so okay let us look at why we need a whole time in this case for the data pin when we want to talk about setup time or whole time we say that at the falling end of the clock this transmission gate becomes transparent and i start to have d written into this first latch huh are you with me yes so now when ck goes to 1 this will become opaque and this will become transparent so it will hold the sample data so now what happens when this becomes transparent then whatever was written on over here will come to queue yes okay so d should be held high until and unless my first part is totally become becoming open yes so this latch is where you may say setup folder defined and so clock to queue delay would totally depend upon the second part of the lens means that sorry the key frame yes in a stable state now if you really want to test the limit and that is what we will now look at if you really want to test the limits then you will say that okay see if i have sampled if i if i've allowed the data in over here if a change in data is reflected from over here then i still have the sampling done okay however if my this node is not very stable sorry if this node the input of this second tri state is not stable then what happens then there could be some extra delay between c k to q okay i know so you define setup and fully times actually based on what is the impact of bringing the closer to the clock edge on the c to q delay we'll just see okay yes thicker but uh is this part clear now yes okay great so for the flip-flop then what we are saying is that for a flip-flop uh we have uh no c known d2q timing and the t percent is replaced by t period so mother you have a yes sir question can we say that this setup time is actually the propagation delay of the first latch uh no don't define setup time as propagation delay setup time is the minimum duration for which data should be stable before clock edge arrives that is the definition of setup time internally what it is equal to okay there are there could be many things there could be delays in clock paths there could be delays in data paths so it is not really propagation delay there is a race condition through which the setup time is defined actually we will see ok ok sure this setup and hold time they are intrinsic to the fifth opera sir is there a way that we can maybe tweak the device parameters and change this uh hold and hold this propagation delay of the data from first from the input to the first latch so if you kind of speed up the input to first latch card delay you can reduce the setup time why not so do we try doing that always yes you always want to minimize the setup control time okay so whatever is the setup and hold time that is the minimum that designer has tried to achieve yeah it can't be otherwise yeah yes sir sir i mean the whole time it is occurring because of the like i want the time difference spent the first transmission gate is completely off and second transmission is complete turning on so that difference you're calling as the whole time again whole time is the duration for which data should be held after the clock edge okay that is the definition so don't confuse the definition with all these implementation details how do i measure the whole time that was the mother was also doing mother was talking about how do i measure the setup time so he saw okay this is the propagation delay this should be equal to setup time what i said was there could be some delays on the clock path also so they need to be reduced and then that becomes set up time not just the propagation delays you're doing the similar assumption that okay this delay is now the whole time no there is always a clock path also and that also needs to be considered when you arrive at the value of full time so but like uh for example the whole time or the setup time we are defining with respect to the input pin of the flop or the latch right so why is my clock path then coming into picture i mean i know that from the rising edge of the clock whenever the rising end of the clock is i will have to give that much margin so if so like how even my like clock path is coming i just have to see that look at the circuit look at the circuit we just analyzed how clock path is important for c to q delay just look at how it is important for a time and whole time you will be able to easily reduce this okay okay and so one more thing so for example when they asked the question of the propagation delay you said that uh there could be some race around condition uh or they could be variations in the rational condition of that input when the i'm getting the large latching action happen so i was not able to get that selectively i said there will be some delays on the clock path so clock and data input are racing amongst each other what would reach the latch first you may buffer the clock inside your circuit no there was this suggestion i think you yourself gave the suggestion that you will put a small pulse on the clock and then a flash would behave like a flop flop you said that no sir someone said that okay so it means that you may want to put some logic on the clock also and that would mean that clock would also arrive at a different time point of time at the latch are you able to see this but like i am not able to get that for example when my clock edge comes then only i do all these kind of things key from then i see key how my d is behaving and put constraints on d after my clock as i have seen so clock that variation can happen anywhere and can clock and arrive any and in any way but after that variation rather we're not talking about variations yet we're simply talking about what is happening variation i will talk about in a little while but we are simply talking about this is the time and clock edge arrives okay from the arriving clock edge i generate an internal clock that is what i take to those tri states so sampling would actually happen when internal clock comes high are you able to see this yes yes sir so there will be some delay from clock to internal clock so this delay would mean that there is more margin for sampling yes sir yes that needs to be added from added to the whole time and reduced from the setup time therefore setup time is not simply the propagation delay and whole time is not simply the propagation delay either yes yes i mean that margins have to be added okay so so one more thing sir with respect to the propagation delays uh internal propagation of the clock i mean they because i can see that there is a fixed path right and that my uh data will always follow after my enter so can i say that the i will have a propagation i can say that there will be a propagation delay only they will be i can come around a stable population there is a one propagation delay because of depending upon the elements because i am having the inverters in between so that propagation delay can also be different for rising and falling edge now yeah for rising and falling how can it be just one propagation delay why do you want to arrive at is the definition that setup and hold time are linked to how much the data should be stable before sampling edge or after something is this definition not simple enough yes okay so i'm happy that you're trying to work it out more but without really doing that analysis on pen and paper yourselves you will simply confuse yourself raghav that is why i said analyze the circuit put a user pen and a paper and you will have all the answers with you so actually i was initially thinking of like uh will there be a contamination kind of thing also coming here because i couldn't think of that so that was there but there will be contamination delays yes wherever there is a propagation delay like tcq there is a contamination delay also there so that was there has to be the datas are not getting here because i was not able to see that they could be alternate paths existing because contamination i think when there is only alternate path existing delay could be because of the falling edge one of the edges is larger or has more delay the other transition is slower because of uh either skewing of inverters or whatever reason can happen okay so different input slew for the different life and getting different delays i can characterize them also as a contamination propagation yeah because earlier you used to think that when the different paths if there is a different path then obviously that that different path would lead to a significantly different propagation and contamination delay but even in the same path there could be very significant difference between propagation and contamination for the two different edges yes sir so you characterize that okay again the definition there is longest delay and shortest delay it never said that it has to be from two different paths did it say that that in the combination we did by calculating effective resistance we used that was examples that was examples what was the definition of propagation today and what was the definition of contamination delay so the shortest delays exactly so that shortest delay is coming for a different edge then that becomes the contamination delay okay so if the different slew is also triggering a shortest delay that can also be a concern yes that is why i'm saying that stick to the definition of setup time as that then measurement is a different thing every circuit you will have to analyze differently and say okay this is my setup time and this is where my whole time is okay that is why i'm saying don't violate the definition the definition is about minimum duration for which data should be stable before clock edge and after blockage before clock edge is set up time after of before sampling at a setup time before after sampling edges hold time okay okay okay stick with this definition now however complex circuit you may encounter you can always find out what the setup and hold time is you have to merge two or three delays you have to simply measure one delay two delays all that is all inconsequential if the definition is clear you will do the implementation correctly okay if you if you learn only one implementation then as soon as another implementation comes you will completely go bonkers you will get confused okay okay so like for example in the timing libraries where i have the characterization for the flops so i have this clock to q delay characterized so in that and in that two parameters are the inputs loo and the load so sir in that table itself i will be getting i will be able to see the minimum value i will say it is contamination and the maximum value in the nldm table itself the propagation even for the same clock and the same load okay the rising transition and falling transition could be different yes sir yeah so two tables yes okay so in those two tables the minimum value i will say that this is a contamination thing yes okay okay so now get it thank you sir okay mother so in in any design process we first do functional simulation without any timing information so if i do not have the all these timing informations then where will my data change i mean uh when whenever i i do uh some design on verilog and test it using a test bench then i see that data all uh almost always changes exactly at the clock edge only not before that not after that so there are delay so there are simulations which you do so what you're talking about is the logical simulation yes a function of simulation no no simulations also have delays embedded in them notional delays unit delays it is referred to as unit delays you you put those delays in terms of unit delays okay okay so yes those functional simulations you will see data will be toggled one unit delay before blockage one unit delay a little before clock edge okay so then that hash one hash zero point like this yes yes so i have to explicitly put it there before uh so in order to get my functionality correct otherwise i don't even get my functionality correct if there are delays yeah if that is how the verilog has been modeled yes okay okay yeah rocker if you have anything else your hand is still raised i'm trying a small question yeah um sir uh for the whole time and basically in the first stage of the flip flop basically there is a latch let's say the flip flop is a positive edge taken and the first stage is the negative latch so sir once the whole time has been uh done for the first latch if the first latch has uh held the data at the output of it so i can now change that d input so largely the uh the whole time of complete flip flop depends upon the whole time of first leg first the setup and hold are largely dependent on the first latch operation that is how if you want to improve the setup and hold you improve the delays in the first latch,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNg8dIZD0zQ,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNg8dIZD0zQ
Transcript: yes sir yeah now it's clear so that is where we have two different timing definitions for d2q and ck2q ah so are these are these timing see i'm spending quite a bit of time on these spamming definitions because they are important these are the kind of questions that will typically be asked in your interviews also yes so uh once you go back please reflect on these timing definitions you will watch need to watch the video again but it is important that you get sufficient clarity on it if you have further questions you can ask the tas ask to ask me to me in the office hours but get sufficient clarity on these aspects okay now we come to the timing parameters for the flip flop do you see some change from earlier what all has changed for the flip flop versus large spamming diagram sampling edge has changed and also now d2q is not there d2q is not there okay and sampling adjustment something that happens we are defining setup and hold on the same edge like it can be different in that yes setup and holder always defined from the sampling edge only yes is the key change is that now you do not have d2q kind of timing because flip flop is not level transparent it's not transparent during at a level it is it just samples at the clock edge okay so very simple we have this instead of t pulse width now we have a timing called t t which is cycle time or period so equity pulse width is no longer there other thing is that t dq is no longer there the perfect is replaced by something called as p period and tdq is simply not there because changes in d will not be reflected anyways they will not be reflected on queue are you able to see this any questions so in my uh previous question only so the clock to queue so for example if i'm in here for example this case uh the flip flop if i take the like transmission gate that implementation in which you had transmission gate and the inverters kind of at low uh feedback so some might exact the path between there is a path between the d2 like uh output i mean the input would flow from the d plane and ultimately they get finally latched to this uh q pin but exactly the clock to queue path i cannot say that exactly there is a clock to queue path i mean are you talking about the flip flop are the lats flip flops are here okay so let's draw the flip flop what are we talking about we have what do you say and in fact we saw that okay there could be q and q bar that are driven like this hello you remember that yes so now you are saying that there is no path from clock to queue but there is a path from d to q so i mean that uh internally with the clock this actually this path is actually i'm really interested in how how much delay for example if i do some changes in my inputs and how for half after how much delay there that input change will be reflected in my output so effectively i should be considering this deep into and q pin right the path between them because clock inputs are not using an input now clock is also an input now yes yes but that input uh i get that but that input is not getting reflected right that is basically controlling the let us say clock was zero yes the clock was zero d could only come till here it came here and it settled here now and put in d the change in d was not reflected on q yes so you cannot have a d to q timing okay okay so this clock is one whether clock is zero whatever it was change in d will not be reflected on q are you with me yes sir yes now let us say a clock toggles what happens now when clock toggles this tri-state also turns active and whatever was stable here is now starting to reflect on q so what has triggered this transition on q is it change in d or is it change in c k there's a change in ck okay that is why the timing is defined from ck to cube okay okay okay so okay i mean what exactly is a triggering edge triggering signal that from where we calculate the delays okay yes okay so okay david you see sir does clock to queue delay depend on the amount of whole time that is sharing i mean suppose you you have told me to uh reduce the profit q delay and my whole time i am not able to do video then uh how do i find it the clock can clock the queue delay be less than whole time it depends how you how your data path how long your data path is and so on so it depends yes it can be done like that that whole time is really very very large but so okay let us look at why we need a whole time in this case for the data pin when we want to talk about setup time or whole time we say that at the falling end of the clock this transmission gate becomes transparent and i start to have d written into this first latch huh are you with me yes so now when ck goes to 1 this will become opaque and this will become transparent so it will hold the sample data so now what happens when this becomes transparent then whatever was written on over here will come to queue yes okay so d should be held high until and unless my first part is totally become becoming open yes so this latch is where you may say setup folder defined and so clock to queue delay would totally depend upon the second part of the lens means that sorry the key frame yes in a stable state now if you really want to test the limit and that is what we will now look at if you really want to test the limits then you will say that okay see if i have sampled if i if i've allowed the data in over here if a change in data is reflected from over here then i still have the sampling done okay however if my this node is not very stable sorry if this node the input of this second tri state is not stable then what happens then there could be some extra delay between c k to q okay i know so you define setup and fully times actually based on what is the impact of bringing the closer to the clock edge on the c to q delay we'll just see okay yes thicker but uh is this part clear now yes okay great so for the flip-flop then what we are saying is that for a flip-flop uh we have uh no c known d2q timing and the t percent is replaced by t period so mother you have a yes sir question can we say that this setup time is actually the propagation delay of the first latch uh no don't define setup time as propagation delay setup time is the minimum duration for which data should be stable before clock edge arrives that is the definition of setup time internally what it is equal to okay there are there could be many things there could be delays in clock paths there could be delays in data paths so it is not really propagation delay there is a race condition through which the setup time is defined actually we will see ok ok sure this setup and hold time they are intrinsic to the fifth opera sir is there a way that we can maybe tweak the device parameters and change this uh hold and hold this propagation delay of the data from first from the input to the first latch so if you kind of speed up the input to first latch card delay you can reduce the setup time why not so do we try doing that always yes you always want to minimize the setup control time okay so whatever is the setup and hold time that is the minimum that designer has tried to achieve yeah it can't be otherwise yeah yes sir sir i mean the whole time it is occurring because of the like i want the time difference spent the first transmission gate is completely off and second transmission is complete turning on so that difference you're calling as the whole time again whole time is the duration for which data should be held after the clock edge okay that is the definition so don't confuse the definition with all these implementation details how do i measure the whole time that was the mother was also doing mother was talking about how do i measure the setup time so he saw okay this is the propagation delay this should be equal to setup time what i said was there could be some delays on the clock path also so they need to be reduced and then that becomes set up time not just the propagation delays you're doing the similar assumption that okay this delay is now the whole time no there is always a clock path also and that also needs to be considered when you arrive at the value of full time so but like uh for example the whole time or the setup time we are defining with respect to the input pin of the flop or the latch right so why is my clock path then coming into picture i mean i know that from the rising edge of the clock whenever the rising end of the clock is i will have to give that much margin so if so like how even my like clock path is coming i just have to see that look at the circuit look at the circuit we just analyzed how clock path is important for c to q delay just look at how it is important for a time and whole time you will be able to easily reduce this okay okay and so one more thing so for example when they asked the question of the propagation delay you said that uh there could be some race around condition uh or they could be variations in the rational condition of that input when the i'm getting the large latching action happen so i was not able to get that selectively i said there will be some delays on the clock path so clock and data input are racing amongst each other what would reach the latch first you may buffer the clock inside your circuit no there was this suggestion i think you yourself gave the suggestion that you will put a small pulse on the clock and then a flash would behave like a flop flop you said that no sir someone said that okay so it means that you may want to put some logic on the clock also and that would mean that clock would also arrive at a different time point of time at the latch are you able to see this but like i am not able to get that for example when my clock edge comes then only i do all these kind of things key from then i see key how my d is behaving and put constraints on d after my clock as i have seen so clock that variation can happen anywhere and can clock and arrive any and in any way but after that variation rather we're not talking about variations yet we're simply talking about what is happening variation i will talk about in a little while but we are simply talking about this is the time and clock edge arrives okay from the arriving clock edge i generate an internal clock that is what i take to those tri states so sampling would actually happen when internal clock comes high are you able to see this yes yes sir so there will be some delay from clock to internal clock so this delay would mean that there is more margin for sampling yes sir yes that needs to be added from added to the whole time and reduced from the setup time therefore setup time is not simply the propagation delay and whole time is not simply the propagation delay either yes yes i mean that margins have to be added okay so so one more thing sir with respect to the propagation delays uh internal propagation of the clock i mean they because i can see that there is a fixed path right and that my uh data will always follow after my enter so can i say that the i will have a propagation i can say that there will be a propagation delay only they will be i can come around a stable population there is a one propagation delay because of depending upon the elements because i am having the inverters in between so that propagation delay can also be different for rising and falling edge now yeah for rising and falling how can it be just one propagation delay why do you want to arrive at

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,L9GhWShlLPU,okay so now given this what are we essentially saying is that at the sampling edge of the clock there has to be a duration for which data remains stable beyond that data can actually be anything similarly after the clock edge comes there is some duration for which data is not stable output is not stable but then output becomes stable after that are you able to see this and are you also able to see raghav you're asking about contamination delay are you also able to see the definition of contamination delay here so i mean after the contamination really i can see some changes in the output yes already output has started to change but now why i'm not considering that as a stable kind of thing i mean because it is not stable yet so because if i take this looks at the shortest delay so as the thought shortest happen and my data is stable now then i mean i'm taking the propagation let us consider the case of a eight bit resistor okay so there are eight flux yes sir for this eight bit resistor the outputs will start to become variable after the contamination delay i mean yes sir i mean yes and they will become stable only after propagation delay are you with me so after the propagation delay see one and one one uh flop in the resistor was to transmit a zero another flop faster transmitter one and so on so the zeros ones zincos the ones that have to transmit a zero they may transmit it a little earlier so they define the tccq the ones that have to transmit a one they might be doing it a little later so they define the tpc finally when is the output stable eight bit output stable only after tpcq so so this is the like the most pessimistic worst case scenario considering okay after this anyway how that data would be stable yes so what do you want to consider worst case so but there could be a case that after the contamination also my data could be stable but i will not consider that as the work i will consider because you're doing a sign off no you don't want things to fail on silicon okay yeah okay so got it sir thank you okay yeah so now if you wish to characterize these setup and hold times what do you do what you do is you start so there's this clock edge you say that i will start to bring my data close to the clock edge and as i do that you will notice that my output delay would increase a bit due to change in output slope okay and when this output delay say increases by 5 it becomes 1.05 times of the the minimum delay that you could observe that is what you call as setup time okay now exactly the same way for the other edge of data also you will notice that as you start to bring the hold edge closer to the q pin to the to the ck transition the c2q delay will again increase okay and again we say that five percent increase that is where the whole time is let us look at in a little detail let us say we have this setup uh this kind of a let us say latch this is a latch so what do we do we say that there is this clock edge the sampling edge of the clock because we are talking about a latch there is this clock edge and data is toggling i will start to bring data closer to the sampling edge and now i want to see what is the tcq as i bring it closer and closer pcq you will see would increase okay as tcq increases our all the timing assumptions start to go haywire so we say that the time the the point at which my tcq has increased by let us say five percent that is my setup time similarly for the same latch there's this hold thing that we're talking about i bring that the transition closer to the clock edge again and you will see again tcq is changing huh so we say that wherever this is more than again say five percent that is my whole time uh sir is this five percent uh standard or it can change from it can be different from from one company to another from one technology to another and all that so don't consider five percent as a standard but in in our course we will consider five percent so sir whatever uh whatever people put in their papers like set up and hold times don't do followers certain criteria like this five percent rule so they will tell it in their paper okay okay i know they will tell it in their paper now they are measured [Music] okay yes david you're asking something yes sir i wanted to ask that about this five percent the points are still plotted so i can say that uh flop is still working but this is uh like a safety limit right yeah it is still working but the timings have gone so high that your system would fail we'll see now we will do the timing closure part okay you're done uh so when you will do the vdf course you will see that there is a setup time the you know sta that we have to do we discuss this in the first lecture of dvd also we want to ensure that all the flip flops every every circuit has a appropriate setup time if you give a clock which is faster than the minimum period that the synthesis run tells you your system can fail so we will just see the timing closure part and you will see that if this standing increases further then all your systems can fail we don't want to do that therefore we say five percent is what we want to keep okay yes president so when we are like when we are changing the not changing when we are making closer the data to the clock pulse uh the clock to queue delay is increasing yes so why is that happening i am not able to like visualize it okay so when the data is toggled much later than clock what happens whatever d was there it remained stable after the after this transmission gate became opaque it changed so can you please repeat the statement let us say that data toggled much after the sampling edge yes sir so in that case what was happening this d1 was very stable yes when when these transmission gates the nmos and pmos were turning off at that point of time this gate was very stable am i right yes yes sir the input was very stable and therefore the the ck2q delay was something yes sir now uh as i bring my data edge closer to the clock edge what happens is so what can happen there can be a small so there can be a disturbance which can move on to the other side yes sir yes sir what does that disturbance do that disturbance actually causes a degrade the slope of the transition over here on the second side okay okay okay yes yes sir therefore if if you measure at say 50 transition yes the delay would change are you able to see this yes sir yes yes sir okay okay so now that we are clear about setup and hold time and how they are to be measured let's look at how is this timing how are these timings signed off on the system level okay so we look at sequencing timing constraints now what does this mean this means that if there is a combinational path between two flip flops what is the minimum clock period that i can give huh or if i am using two phase latches there is a positive edge level triggered latch and there is a negative level trigger latch or there are two phase transition latches i have two clocks okay then what kind of combinational logic can i put in the two regions there huh what kind of combinational delay can i put in those regions there or as i i'm missing out on who mentioned about the pulsed latches if i make if i create a very short pulse over here then how much combinational delay can be put over here again are you able to see this so whenever we are designing a sequential circuit we want to find out what is the fastest at which my my system can run am i right and that fastest could be different for a regular flip-flop based architecture or a two-phase latch based architecture or pulse architects pulse latch based architectures are you able to see this yes uh sir but this uh if we are able to make the first latches that is fine but why don't we use them because they are smaller as well so they are used who says they're not used okay i thought that flip flops are more preferred since sometimes there is warning even in synthesized uh when we will see we will see why pulse latches have problems and why flip flops are better that we can see that is not a problem but all flashes are used they are flexible also like the timing is kind of they are used they are very widely used widely matlab and and and some kind of design and some in some parts of the industry they are very widely used not everywhere because there could be some reasons then we will look into those reasons but yeah that's that is why we are discussing them over here so a quick recap of the different delays we will now you know call logic propagation delays as cpd and pcb propagation and contamination delays are tpd and ppcd the clock based propagation delays as a propagation c2q and contamination c2q latch would also have propagation delay from data to queue and blocks and from a contamination delay from d to q and for latches and flux we will also have these timings called setup and holds all of these we will consider when we talk about sign off of the product sir yes so what do you mean exactly by sequencing uh i was the term sequencing what do you mean by that no okay what do you understand so like discuss this in the first part of the sequential circuit section so what do you understand by sequencing so is it like uh related to pipelining can we can we said that yeah i mean how how i put uh my combinational part a combinational part between the flip-flops and that is basically the sequencing thing yeah i'm saying and so i had a doubt regarding the two-phase uh pulse latched uh implementation uh so can you move to the previous slide we will talk about two phase first letters in much detail okay so i mean i understand the flip flop implementation so i answer with respect to these two phase pulse latches so i can see that this uh what i need is that from the sampling edge my data should be available to be stable data available so all this uh time for which my clock period is high that basically is not uh is basically uh i don't want that right i want my why would i consider backlog should be i i don't want the clock to be high for a very long time right depends you will see this is not a default assumption that you can make we will see there is a benefit of having a pulse we will want to do some time borrowing and then we will need this

Transcript: okay so now given this what are we essentially saying is that at the sampling edge of the clock there has to be a duration for which data remains stable beyond that data can actually be anything similarly after the clock edge comes there is some duration for which data is not stable output is not stable but then output becomes stable after that are you able to see this and are you also able to see raghav you're asking about contamination delay are you also able to see the definition of contamination delay here so i mean after the contamination really i can see some changes in the output yes already output has started to change but now why i'm not considering that as a stable kind of thing i mean because it is not stable yet so because if i take this looks at the shortest delay so as the thought shortest happen and my data is stable now then i mean i'm taking the propagation let us consider the case of a eight bit resistor okay so there are eight flux yes sir for this eight bit resistor the outputs will start to become variable after the contamination delay i mean yes sir i mean yes and they will become stable only after propagation delay are you with me so after the propagation delay see one and one one uh flop in the resistor was to transmit a zero another flop faster transmitter one and so on so the zeros ones zincos the ones that have to transmit a zero they may transmit it a little earlier so they define the tccq the ones that have to transmit a one they might be doing it a little later so they define the tpc finally when is the output stable eight bit output stable only after tpcq so so this is the like the most pessimistic worst case scenario considering okay after this anyway how that data would be stable yes so what do you want to consider worst case so but there could be a case that after the contamination also my data could be stable but i will not consider that as the work i will consider because you're doing a sign off no you don't want things to fail on silicon okay yeah okay so got it sir thank you okay yeah so now if you wish to characterize these setup and hold times what do you do what you do is you start so there's this clock edge you say that i will start to bring my data close to the clock edge and as i do that you will notice that my output delay would increase a bit due to change in output slope okay and when this output delay say increases by 5 it becomes 1.05 times of the the minimum delay that you could observe that is what you call as setup time okay now exactly the same way for the other edge of data also you will notice that as you start to bring the hold edge closer to the q pin to the to the ck transition the c2q delay will again increase okay and again we say that five percent increase that is where the whole time is let us look at in a little detail let us say we have this setup uh this kind of a let us say latch this is a latch so what do we do we say that there is this clock edge the sampling edge of the clock because we are talking about a latch there is this clock edge and data is toggling i will start to bring data closer to the sampling edge and now i want to see what is the tcq as i bring it closer and closer pcq you will see would increase okay as tcq increases our all the timing assumptions start to go haywire so we say that the time the the point at which my tcq has increased by let us say five percent that is my setup time similarly for the same latch there's this hold thing that we're talking about i bring that the transition closer to the clock edge again and you will see again tcq is changing huh so we say that wherever this is more than again say five percent that is my whole time uh sir is this five percent uh standard or it can change from it can be different from from one company to another from one technology to another and all that so don't consider five percent as a standard but in in our course we will consider five percent so sir whatever uh whatever people put in their papers like set up and hold times don't do followers certain criteria like this five percent rule so they will tell it in their paper okay okay i know they will tell it in their paper now they are measured [Music] okay yes david you're asking something yes sir i wanted to ask that about this five percent the points are still plotted so i can say that uh flop is still working but this is uh like a safety limit right yeah it is still working but the timings have gone so high that your system would fail we'll see now we will do the timing closure part okay you're done uh so when you will do the vdf course you will see that there is a setup time the you know sta that we have to do we discuss this in the first lecture of dvd also we want to ensure that all the flip flops every every circuit has a appropriate setup time if you give a clock which is faster than the minimum period that the synthesis run tells you your system can fail so we will just see the timing closure part and you will see that if this standing increases further then all your systems can fail we don't want to do that therefore we say five percent is what we want to keep okay yes president so when we are like when we are changing the not changing when we are making closer the data to the clock pulse uh the clock to queue delay is increasing yes so why is that happening i am not able to like visualize it okay so when the data is toggled much later than clock what happens whatever d was there it remained stable after the after this transmission gate became opaque it changed so can you please repeat the statement let us say that data toggled much after the sampling edge yes sir so in that case what was happening this d1 was very stable yes when when these transmission gates the nmos and pmos were turning off at that point of time this gate was very stable am i right yes yes sir the input was very stable and therefore the the ck2q delay was something yes sir now uh as i bring my data edge closer to the clock edge what happens is so what can happen there can be a small so there can be a disturbance which can move on to the other side yes sir yes sir what does that disturbance do that disturbance actually causes a degrade the slope of the transition over here on the second side okay okay okay yes yes sir therefore if if you measure at say 50 transition yes the delay would change are you able to see this yes sir yes yes sir okay okay so now that we are clear about setup and hold time and how they are to be measured let's look at how is this timing how are these timings signed off on the system level okay so we look at sequencing timing constraints now what does this mean this means that if there is a combinational path between two flip flops what is the minimum clock period that i can give huh or if i am using two phase latches there is a positive edge level triggered latch and there is a negative level trigger latch or there are two phase transition latches i have two clocks okay then what kind of combinational logic can i put in the two regions there huh what kind of combinational delay can i put in those regions there or as i i'm missing out on who mentioned about the pulsed latches if i make if i create a very short pulse over here then how much combinational delay can be put over here again are you able to see this so whenever we are designing a sequential circuit we want to find out what is the fastest at which my my system can run am i right and that fastest could be different for a regular flip-flop based architecture or a two-phase latch based architecture or pulse architects pulse latch based architectures are you able to see this yes uh sir but this uh if we are able to make the first latches that is fine but why don't we use them because they are smaller as well so they are used who says they're not used okay i thought that flip flops are more preferred since sometimes there is warning even in synthesized uh when we will see we will see why pulse latches have problems and why flip flops are better that we can see that is not a problem but all flashes are used they are flexible also like the timing is kind of they are used they are very widely used widely matlab and and and some kind of design and some in some parts of the industry they are very widely used not everywhere because there could be some reasons then we will look into those reasons but yeah that's that is why we are discussing them over here so a quick recap of the different delays we will now you know call logic propagation delays as cpd and pcb propagation and contamination delays are tpd and ppcd the clock based propagation delays as a propagation c2q and contamination c2q latch would also have propagation delay from data to queue and blocks and from a contamination delay from d to q and for latches and flux we will also have these timings called setup and holds all of these we will consider when we talk about sign off of the product sir yes so what do you mean exactly by sequencing uh i was the term sequencing what do you mean by that no okay what do you understand so like discuss this in the first part of the sequential circuit section so what do you understand by sequencing so is it like uh related to pipelining can we can we said that yeah i mean how how i put uh my combinational part a combinational part between the flip-flops and that is basically the sequencing thing yeah i'm saying and so i had a doubt regarding the two-phase uh pulse latched uh implementation uh so can you move to the previous slide we will talk about two phase first letters in much detail okay so i mean i understand the flip flop implementation so i answer with respect to these two phase pulse latches so i can see that this uh what i need is that from the sampling edge my data should be available to be stable data available so all this uh time for which my clock period is high that basically is not uh is basically uh i don't want that right i want my why would i consider backlog should be i i don't want the clock to be high for a very long time right depends you will see this is not a default assumption that you can make we will see there is a benefit of having a pulse we will want to do some time borrowing and then we will need this okay"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,uoVAuUDzOT4,okay so but before we enter into the timing closure part i think it is important to understand some variabilities that need to be accounted for when we do timing closure okay rather is that anything else that is pending i see your hand raised okay so there are some and uncertainties that we need to manage where could those uncertainties come from they could come from clock generation the pll that is generating the clock that could have some litter in it that could have some you know different delays across different time time zones whatever there could be drift in the in the oscillator and so on then there are device variations there are power supply variations there are interconnect variations where you could have a crosstalk between interconnects and therefore when both the signals are rising you have one kind of delay when one of the signals is falling you will have a different kind of a delay and so on there could be variations in temperature there could be variations in loading of different of different flops or stuff like that and so on so there are many uncertainties that clock arriving at any flop would see what we are saying is see yaha we were saying that what is the delay between one flop and another both the pins are being referred to as clock but what can actually happen is that one flop is experiencing delay through this path and the other path is experiencing delay through this path and there are so many different sources of variations that could occur for the two flip flops this is called as clock uncertainty and this needs to be accounted for in our closure analysis so these non-idealities include clock skew clock jitter and variation and pulse width now it is very important to understand the difference between clock skew and clock jitter clock skew is the spatial variation in temporally equivalent clock edges what does this statement mean who can clarify this cryptic statement for all of us sir it is the difference between uh the time the delta time difference between uh the exact moment at which we want this clock to arrive the flop to the uh actual value the actual time at which we are receiving this at different places at different places ranjit we're talking about spatial variation so there is there is one there is one flop so there is this uh circuit or that you have designed circuit name as our system that you designed there is one flop that is here another flop that is here you assumed okay and the output of this is going to the input of this let us say there is some combinational logic in there huh so you assumed that clock would arrive here at time instant t0 but the very fact that these two nodes these two flops are so far apart the clock arriving here could be arriving at t1 this is clock's queue okay yes now what is clock data so clock skew is between two different flops we're talking about spatial variation now what is clock jitter it is within the clock generation itself basically it is a kind of random by my clock might have some time period and then i'll i see that at some points of time the clock positive edge is not coming at the expected time it is coming right somewhere so now we're talking about same flops anyway she now we're talking about the same flop where we say that due to uh let us say variations in in the pll through which you generated your clock or whatever you know after some time it got heated up or uh this is the the wire is this clock is reaching this flop and in between there is a set of other wires which it gets to see crosstalk with in one cycle there was a supportive crosstalk and in another cycle there was a destructive crosstalk huh so between two cycles of the same flop itself what am i seeing the next clock edge could arrive a little early if there is constructive crosstalk or a little late if there is destructive crosstalk and this is called as jitter temporal variations so spatial variation is skew for temporally equivalent it was the same rising edge of the clock that we were considering whereas clock jitter is about same flop receiving same flop receiving clock from multiple clock so same flow of same clock but that clock actually getting impacted differently over different cycles now that is clock data then there is a variation in pulse width variation and time period again which could be because of some some crosstalk or something like that which could happen in the system crosstalk is easy to understand therefore i am using the word crosstalk more often but as we just saw there are so many other sources of variations so uh that is called as clock uh you know variation of pulse width and all these things need to be taken care of when you do timing try knots so what we are talking about is that the skew is between two clock arriving at two different flops so this could be ff1 and this could be ff2 clock arriving at two different flops but jitter is about clock edge arriving at a flop coming a little earlier or a little later okay so what does this mean when you have jitter it means that this could be your t period minimum t period or in worst cases your t period could actually be longer also are you able to see this sir in case i want to model this uh clock uncertainty it is kind of increasing my setup and hold time for the worst cases yes that is what i am talking about right away now we will go into timing analysis so yes so the clocks queue and the jitter both will be model uh under like uncertainty clock uncertainty that different kinds of uncertainties only there are different kinds of uncertainties yes okay and so as i can see that the skew is because of the routing of the clock because the clock is routing different parts exist yes and sir jitter is because of the variations like temporal variations which could be there at one point of time and may not be there at another point of time okay yes clock skew could also be because of variations but they are fixed variations they could be temporal also but fixed fixed also okay the clock jitter is only because of temporal variations okay so sir like for example as you were in the uncertainty slide use do you shows that they are like the one was uh uncertainty there was variation in the source in the device and the temperature these kind of variations can both lead to the skew and jitter i mean okay okay i mean it is not like that is queue is dated because only because of the routing thing only no okay and so also i can see that like the skew the uncertainty thing the jitter thing it is very unpredictable kind of thing yeah and i they whether it will be there or not i cannot definitely say yeah but skew is more kind of uh deterministic i mean say i can still kind of good i'm so happy that you are arriving at this reduction so but then how will be taking account this answer the jitter thing kind of because that would be very difficult yes sir we have to leave the margins then okay so i just wanted to ask if the uh when the clock is input at a transmission gate which is as an input to a flip t flip flop so that would uh there would be some phase delay between the inverted clock and the normal clock so that is counted in skew right uh that would also be counted and that will actually become evident and set up and hold time itself because the inverted clock is generated usually generated inside the flop itself ins no i'm but you've seen the symbol of a flip flop there is only one clock input no is there a clock input for cq got it sorry i know got it got it okay ckb is an internal signal okay okay okay thank you yeah so just one more thing also want to ask so the margins that we'll be giving for this queue and the data where we will it be different or like same only let us see okay okay so what we are essentially saying is that there could be skew um there could be skew which could be positive or negative we are talking about two flops a clock could be coming from this side or clock could be coming from this side huh in one case this flop will receive the clock a little earlier than this one and in the other case the flop will receive the clock a little later than the first one when it receives later it is called positive skew when it receives earlier it is called negative skew are you able to see this any questions sir it is about the launching of the clock the point of launch yeah okay so now what this means is that if there is a combinational path in between them it could happen that i have positive skew or i i have negative q and we need to see what is the impact of skew on my paths length or the on the clock period so if for example i have a positive skewed clock then we realize that this combinational logic can be slightly longer whereas if i have a negative skew path my combinational logic will have to be slightly smaller shorter in in length are you able to see this hello guys so can you can you elaborate this so clock arrived here at tclk one yes sir clock arrives here at tclk2 yes sir let us say combinational logic has a delay of tcomb huh if eclk 1 was the clock that would arrive at the second flop also then what is the constraint you have to see if the second drop also has the clock arriving at this edge only then what is it that you have to see you have to ensure that the delay in your combinational logic has to be less than tclk yes sir yes sir but since tclk 2 is arriving a little later now i have this extra delta duration in which i can still have my combinational logic do some magic yes sir this is where you get some benefit yes yes and if it was a negative edge you will actually have lesser time for your combinational logic i would say i will be less worried about the whole time now in the negative you will be less worried about the whole time so we'll just see let us say that i have timings like pcq propagation pcq contamination p setup p hold d logic these logic contamination what is the minimum cycle time that you can keep in this system empty clock to queue press t logic yeah what we say is that the next edge could be coming after a negative skew so t minus delta should be equal to or larger than pcq propagation delay plus setup time plus the logic delay over here are you able to see this sir here i may consider the negative skew yes that is the that is the worst case is it not okay right now let us look at the other side also how do you same flop now how do you what is the constraint that is put upon hold time what do you want now over here you will say that tclk2 will arrive later than cclk1 so we say that we're now looking at uh what do you say the skew to be added in the whole time requirement we say that the contamination delay the fastest input can come to this and the contamination delay of this combinational logic should be greater than the whole time requirement of this flop plus delta are you able to see this so can you explain this again so this whole one so if i say that let us forget data for now let us forget data for now i just want that there should be no hold time violations what do i need to ensure that when the next clock edge comes pclk2 comes after that also my earlier input must have remained stable for how long t hold long huh so the delay the minimum delay that i get from input to let us say from the i n pin to let us say this point is has to be greater than p hold is this part here so in the setup thing in when the setup time constraint we are considering one uh we are considering two time two clock edges which are like t period apart but in the whole time we are considering the same clock edges yes whole time is always with the same blockage so sir uh okay so hold time come up look here let us understand that whole time says that when my clock edge comes the data from the previous or any transitions from the previous flop should not have reached me yet after t hold period i know that was how we defined the whole time now this was set up time and this was whole time hello yes sir so we are saying that after clock edge arrives even after that no transition should happen until t hold yes yes sir so delays contamination delays of this and this should be lesser should be greater than p hold so uh sir for example when the same clock is arrived at both this flip flop so it will start processing it will start it will do the and for the next flip flop i want the latching to happen not this input to be transmitted to that so but like why uh in the previous slides when we are consuming the contamination the propagation thing you were saying that we consider the for the contamination delay we are not sure that the data will be stable or the queue will be stable or not so why i'm not consuming the propagation here and the contamination should have happened or no dimensional input should happen before whole time happens yes i don't have the d the d pin of the next at the r2 register that let us call this signal x this x should not toggle before hold time has elapsed yes sir yes yes sir i know yes sir so you are now looking at the shortest delays yes sir that is how you use the contamination delay part so now that i am able to get so but for example you also said the input to be uh stably available at the output that for that we consider the propagation thing because we are not sure that the data will be stable at the output q pin of the register one because then that only will be propagating towards let us say let us say there are these glitches that appear okay what is so and let us say this is the sampling edge what do you want the first glitch should happen after whole time now okay right i mean i don't have to concern about the stables in stable signal just any differently changing you do not want any transition to happen okay even the first glitch should not arrive which means that i have to look at the contamination delay yes so yes yes okay and here we say that we have a negative skew therefore we would add data also to the requirement a positive q i think negative skew receiving edges arriving early uh ah late late sorry yes positive skill again the receiving edge is arriving late so that that adds to the requirement there okay is it clear till here friends i need some feedback this is very very important concept yes okay now we look at jitter for jitter what we are saying is that there is a variation in clock arrival itself clock would arrive a little early the clock edge could arrive a little early or a little later so now we have added this t jitter also into the timing system huh and now what would be the impact let us say on uh earliest arrival time or earliest launch time based on that you will see that this is how my setup or clock period and hold requirements would change you will see that two jitter would get added one set of jitter for the launching edge and one set of jitter for the capturing edge [Music] but if you're talking about uh clock period two jitters will be added so can we say that because of jitter the if essential time period has him has been impacted uh from the source uh can we say that because of jitter jitter the original time period of the clock was impacted yes yeah but you have to the the see you're doing sign off at uh at one frequency you've done the sign off but now you need to leave the margin for jitter because during sign off you cannot do your sta tools cannot and take care of these variations there can it right right right right i know good yeah so this data is not exactly clear i mean how you're incorporating this okay you tell me look at this waveform yes so what happens so agar if you just look at the uh set of time velar requirements yes sir what could happen instead of clock arriving at the desired time it arrives a little later yes on the first block and for the second flop instead of it arriving at the regular time it arrived a little earlier so yes all the delays now will need to be measured from here which is jitter jitter later and they should be sampled jitter duration earlier so you have to leave margin of two jitter in your overall calculation so but like when he was explaining today he was saying that in the same flop how matt is arriving even two different problems so i'm here also there will be jitter nah yes yes sir okay so so like in in in my in my skew uh constraint when my with the equation that i done skew constraint only i will subtract this two times digit i will add this zipper also twice so this is for the setup yeah okay okay similarly for the hold what do you see clock launched a little earlier because of jitter so what happens now uh your jitter uh comes so it launched a little earlier it launched a little earlier on the first flap and on the second flop it it it came a little later because of jitter only i know so data must not arrive af before the hold plus jitter now so you have cq plus the logic path delay minus jitter has to be greater than hold requirement plus jitter plus q so again you see two jitter got added so in my in my the capturing flip flop the i i should be considering the case of the positive skew for the whole time to be constrained yeah yeah but so for the uh starting flip flop what exactly did you did so that was not clear i mean we just looked at jitter yes see and it is it was intended to come here it came a little earlier because of jitter so it got launched earlier the transitions got launched a little earlier,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoVAuUDzOT4,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoVAuUDzOT4

not okay right now let us look at the other side also how do you same flop now how do you what is the constraint that is put upon hold time what do you want now over here you will say that tclk2 will arrive later than cclk1 so we say that we're now looking at uh what do you say the skew to be added in the whole time requirement we say that the contamination delay the fastest input can come to this

have a negative skew therefore we would add data also to the requirement a positive q i think negative skew receiving edges arriving early uh ah late late sorry yes positive skill again the receiving edge is arriving late so that that adds to the requirement there okay is it clear till here friends i need some feedback this is very very important concept yes okay now we look at jitter for jitter what we are saying is that there is a variation in clock arrival itself clock would arrive a little early the clock edge could arrive a little early or a little later so now we have added this t jitter also into the timing system huh and now what would be the impact let us say on uh earliest arrival time or earliest launch time based on that you will see that this is how my setup or clock period and hold requirements would change you will see that two jitter would get added one set of jitter for the launching edge and one set of jitter for the capturing edge [Music] but if you're talking about uh clock period two jitters will be added so can we say that because of jitter the if essential time period has him has been impacted uh from the source uh can we say that because of jitter jitter the original time period of the clock was impacted yes yeah but you have to the the see you're doing sign off at uh at one frequency you've done the sign off but now you need to leave the margin for jitter because during sign off you cannot do your sta tools cannot and take care of these variations there can it right right right right i know good yeah so this data is not exactly clear i mean how you're incorporating this okay you tell me look at this waveform yes so what happens so agar if you just look at the uh set of time velar requirements yes sir what could happen instead of clock arriving at the desired time it arrives a little later yes on the first block and for the second flop instead of it arriving at the regular time it arrived a little earlier so yes all the delays now will need to be measured from here which is jitter jitter later and they should be sampled jitter duration earlier so you have to leave margin of two jitter in your overall calculation so but like when he was explaining today he was saying that in the same flop how matt is arriving even two different problems so i'm here also there will be jitter nah yes yes sir okay so so like in in in my in my skew uh constraint when my with the equation that i done skew constraint only i will subtract this two times digit i will add this zipper also twice so this is for the setup yeah okay okay similarly for the hold what do you see clock launched a little earlier because of jitter so what happens now uh your jitter uh comes so it launched a little earlier it launched a little earlier on the first flap and on the second flop it it it came a little later because of jitter only i know so data must not arrive af before the hold plus jitter now so you have cq plus the logic path delay minus jitter has to be greater than hold requirement plus jitter plus q so again you see two jitter got added so in my in my the capturing flip flop the i i should be considering the case of the positive skew for the whole time to be constrained yeah yeah but so for the uh starting flip flop what exactly did you did so that was not clear i mean we just looked at jitter yes see and it is it was intended to come here it came a little earlier because of jitter so it got launched earlier the transitions got launched a little earlier"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,RRwHlqcV7MI,how do i put it how do we uh now move to other types of uh let us say two phase latches and pulse latches how do we do timing closure there for this one uh what would what should be that like how can you please help me complete this equation over here what should come after this this is still the ideal case let us forget about jitter and the uh skew yet so the uh logic uh delay should be lesser than a complete time period minus setup time and minus the clock to queue delay of the first flip flop very good so this setup time plus propagation delay of the first flip flop this is called as sequencing overhead okay because had your combinational logic not been broken and though these flops not been inserted there your total delay would have been tpd only cpd only needed to be less than pc but now there is an additional thing which has come here which is called as sequencing overhead okay now if we look at two phase latches so there are two phases of clock phase one and phase two which are kind of as you will notice non-overlapping so what comes here tpd one plus tpd two should be less than so what is due to the two phase of the clock i mean what exactly is the implementation the implementation could be that uh there is an inverter in the end so i'm asking what exactly by by taking the two phases of the clock mean what exactly does it mean two phases of clock so there is a clock which has uh high so there is uh there's a clock which goes high once and another clock which goes high at a 90 degree phase shift okay so so we have two latches and we are providing different clock signals to both of them yeah alternate latches we are providing the other face okay sir here you you have not considered setup is is that because you have enough time like you have assumed that setup is kind of already not a problem so where is the setup of our latch considered so it will be on the falling edge of fighting you have to tell me what should be the uh how do i complete this equation there is a minus sign here i do not i have not yet put what goes after this you have to tell me that tpd1 ctpdq1 minus tpdq2 okay tpd 1 plus tpd2 should be less than what should be less than tc minus tpd q1 minus tpd q2 as i can see from this diagram tpdq1 and tpdq okay so the sequencing overhead over here is defined by two tpdq assuming that both the latches are designed okay what else so if you use both what would happen so can we move to previous slides yeah so i we mean considering the uh this tpd one for example i know that uh after my combinational one has process and combination two both have processed i'm taking the uh the constraint at the latch three basically at the so yeah writing this here for the before the rising edge of this this latch comes i just want to see so but shouldn't it be the falling edge of this latch last three i mean because then only because the uh my sampling is that only for the following edge yeah so you have to be careful anime over here now if i'm starting from the rising as i've started to do the analysis from the rising edge and then doing stuff like that sir then i have to because i i want to find that clock period only so we'll come to this aspect that you're absolutely right in the fact that this combinational delay can actually be a little longer than this it may come a little here also what's the problem you're right in that that is what we will call as time borrowing we will review that today okay that is very easily possible in this two phase lab system but a b because we are talking about clock period itself therefore we are talking about rising edge of these two five okay okay and also like for example uh though i'm considering my clock period for this uh like latch was for the same phases of the clock five one only so but like intermediately i have this latch too and it will also have its like setup constraints and all that but i am not considering that key because at least in this timing diagram if you see we are saying that this output of or input of latch has become stable much before its falling edge okay so i'm not really bothered about setup just yet as as i move forward you will see i will talk about all those aspects also okay we are starting simple okay okay so sir here we are considering the constraint slide i only want to see what is the minimum sequencing overhead the system would have i'm not even looking at other timing constraints yet okay and so just for the because i have taken the rising edge so i have uh that's why i'm not considering till the falling edge of the yeah okay that's it uh yes right you had the same question of uh why aren't we considering the setup and the old uh limit let's consider don't worry we can't miss those aspects because because the clock period for sure it will depend upon the um uh hold constraint yeah we'll just consider yes sir so yeah so how we've got this equation like y minus 2 tb dq do you realize that this tpd queue is the extra thing that is coming in the combinational logic path no sir so this delay from d2 to q2 d2 to q2 yeah yes sir if if our system had no sequencing there yes i just said d2 to queue okay would not have been there now yes yes sir so this is the extra delay this is overhead yes sir or is maybe talking about sequencing overhead the slide is only about sequencing overhead okay okay take a second yes yes sir okay so just one more thing so here we are not considering the clock to queue because we are considering that the clock is stable even off before that data changes so because for the latches we had two kinds of delay right clockwise yeah we said data became stable normally after clock came high now that is what we have done over here is it not okay so data is changing after the clock is stable yeah so therefore c2 queue banana look at the timing diagram and then we see there are obviously so many other timing definitions not all are being reviewed over here in this particular slide i know in this particular timing diagram we are talking about sequencing over and we see it is equal to 2t pdq now look at this timing diagram now what is the sequencing overhead here this is pulsed latches so there is a short pulse there is a short pulse and something is happening and now you will notice there are two cases there is a case linked to pulse width being greater than setup and pulse width being less than setup are you able to see this the sequencing overhead here who can justify this for me said this double one yeah this is a amalgamation of both the diagrams so basically what you are saying is when pulse width is very small then you have to make the data stable even before the clock even rises yeah you cannot expect that dc completely you able to see this if the setup time requirement is something then i will use that setup time that data should be stable at least set up time before the clock falling edge comes [Music] so i mean uh i'm somehow able to get for example that why the tpdq and tpcq would be different but like why was considering this dp pulse with subtracting the perspect this equation is not getting clear so you launched the data from here pricing edge yes sir we are sampling it at the falling edge setup time is from the falling so what is the time period considered from the uh rising edge okay okay rising and the rising yes sir but time period is from rising to rising so this pulse width has to be reduced now so can you please repeat i'm not able to get so are you able to see that sampling will happen at the falling edge of clock over here yes sir however i want to find the delay up to rising edge of the clock yes so tc may i will have so my window in which i am doing this timing constraint is equal to tc plus cpw my entire constraint is between tc plus cpw are you able to see this because the sampling edge is this okay so okay okay in the two phase we didn't consider this in this we are considering it in the two phase because we are assuming that pulse widths are large enough and that data will like and the two phases are also almost equivalent that is why we did not consider it in the last slide so tc is from center of the first pulse to center of the second perspective no rising of the first pulse to the rising of the second pulse seeker rising to securizing is dc okay so like uh here though my tc is from the rising to rising but i am considering the path from the rising till the falling out start okay and that's why i have to subtract this dpw from the overhead from the oh so here essentially we have considered both the cases uh if the queue is being triggered by the data or the clock yes more mature statements as we move forward more and more things will get included there sir yes sir the risk of setup time violation would be much more for second guess right why if i have met the timing then there is no risk but uh what i can see is because setup time is included in the pulse width itself in the first case but in the second case the propagation delay need of the combination logic need to be a bit lower i guess so they breathe it is not about propagation delay being lower it is about what is your clock period you have some propagation delay what is the clock period that you want to give okay so the given time requirement of your latch or the flop okay so any there is not any risk anywhere if you're meeting the timing requirements if you're qualifying these equations there is no risk anywhere that is why we want to do static timing analysis that is what where you want to do sign off okay yes okay [Music] we are taking the maximum of both this d2 and c2 is that because uh i'm not sure in different cycles my pulse bits might also vary because uh i can see that in if the setup and set up time and password these two are constant then either of one should come there's no chance of others no the thing is that my pulse width is very short my pulse width is very short and i do know understand that my setup may have happened before the rising edge of the clock itself yes now if that is the case then tcq becomes valid yes now it could happen that my pulse width is not that short so my password is like this and data toggle somewhere here so then what will become valid tdq but but in same system the pulse width could be defined and the same in the in the particular system we are talking about the pulse weight of the pulse whatever we are giving will be defined so basically one of these should come the max of these would come because the cookiaga if i say that if i if i consider data to be to be stable uh how do i show it okay let us say my data toggled here for this particular case after the clock had arrived let us say for now what would happen will it meet the setup time requirement in case setup is higher than if it would unprofit no i know but if the person is large enough then this would meet the set of time requirements just in d2q but my data has arrived after the clock edge yes so i will therefore use tdq for my purposes yes in the previous case or in this case it says if data had toggled before because setup time was larger let us say setup time was this much so data toggled here however so the cq is this much let us say tdq was this it won't matter because it is not why will it not matter the clock has gone high my data is there it has met the setup time but tdq is not met yet my output will not toggle until here so this is not clear at this point so do you realize that it is always max of tdq and pcq which will come into picture let us say let us forget about this this particular pulse latch here let us look at any latch okay now data toggled here i'll open it data toggled here and set up time to following at second app data toggled here and q is expected so this is data and q is expected when will the earliest queue arrive earlier sq will arise either after tcq or after tdq am i right yes sir yes no if this tdq is larger than tcq what happens so data will arrive after pdq will now arrive after tdq yes sir i know so even though clock clock edge had come after data toggling but even then tdq is the defining delay so in this case the triggering would be the clock edge but the delay wouldn't be the clock to queue yes sir physically thinking about it would be kind of this dd2 when a clock blockage is a triggering point and td cube and blockage is not the trading point these two can be also different these two delays yeah the delays could be different yes delays could be different so you will have to you will have to characterize your system in its completeness and then then do the timing sign off yes here in the equation it should be pc plus t tp w minus all the other things right so that is what it is now so here we are saying the sampling would be done at the negative edge that's [Music] okay okay okay we are considering the case where the data d1 is toggling at the rising edge of the clock not necessarily d1 could be toggling after the rising of the clock also yeah in that case if we consider the data change after the rising edge of somewhere midway then this equation doesn't hold good right because we'll be considering somewhere in the midway of the clock when it is high and then from there we are considering tdq but we are considering uh tc plus tpw so the rest of the uh time where uh that the time delta between the rising edge of the clock and from where the data has traveled so that portion uh essentially is not uh we are just adding that here look at it like this if there was this extra region if there is this xy region at the input side on the input side of d1 then you also have this exfolia region in the output side so setup requirement at the falling edge of the next flop next latch would also be there so there's something like what we did in the previous slide you remember assuming we just looked we just went ahead assuming there were no no other challenges so you will see that we will look at all these additional challenges as we go forward have we taken a simple case here okay and we're talking about the sequencing overhead and the other thing okay sir yes sir i think ranjit talked about the overhead that is minus of tpw minus t setup if because if you take the minus sign out it becomes actually becomes tpw minus t setup which is the overhead uh when data is coming after the pulse means uh at the middle of the pulse i don't know what are you saying i'm saying that if pulse width is large enough say and the data is coming at the middle of the pulse width and also the state of time is not violating so the difference between the when the clock edge has come and when the data is talking let us just step back a little let us just step back a little i want to find the shortest pc you said i want to find the fastest frequency at which my system can operate so the smallest pc so would i want data to just waste some timing delay somewhere no so what you are talking about is a relaxed cycle there are margins there already that is not where you will do timing sign off yes it is okay yes so that is where if you if you look at a relaxed cycle then no equation for example in the second case when the password is less than t set up so you have considered the tpcq but here we as earlier discussion it could be tp dq also right that is why we use the max of tpdq and ppcq okay and so so one more thing sir like uh i'm able to get that why we are subtracting the password from this so but like the pulse we are subtracting this pulse fit because of the way that we have defined like how we are measuring that no because it's a latch it's on the falling edge of the clock that the sampling would happen it is not about what we defined or not just that is the latch we have that additional window in which we could have our system set up sampling edge is the falling edge of clock not the rising edge of block yes sir so but like we have then subtracted that window right we've actually added that to tc we've subtracted that from the sequencing overhead okay because we've added that to the tc this is the extra margin we have for the propagation delay there okay so sir like for our calculation we start the calculation from the rising edge of the first latch and we consider it till the falling of the next latch yes that is the entire window in which your system should settle down completely is it not yes yeah so but the same we didn't do for the earlier one uh you would want to do it for the earlier one also but because the pulse which is very very large so you can end up getting confused over there so it's it's the same equation that will be valid for up there also okay so okay so but like i'm getting still confused that the clock the time period like when we define the setup now let us do it like this again you will have to review this session yes after the class okay you'll have to work it out yourself okay sir unless you work it out yourself this is a clear name however much time i speak over,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRwHlqcV7MI,"Link:

want to do it for the earlier one also but because the pulse which is very very large so you can end up getting confused over there so it's it's the same equation that will be valid for up there also okay so okay so but like i'm getting still confused that the clock the time period like when we define the setup now let us do it like this again you will have to review this session yes after the class okay you'll have to work it out yourself okay sir unless you work it out yourself this is a clear name however much time i speak over"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,EczTGsbBEKA,here okay okay sir yeah so now about the whole time contamination delays what would you say about this we already discussed the flops the contamination [Music] contamination delay should be greater than the whole minus tcc now over here we have assumed that both the clocks arrived at the same time there would be skew there and then we will have to consider skew also which we did in the last class already yes sir okay what about midday mid-lane two-phase latches mendelian two-phase latches we would want that the 51 triggered output should reach l2 after the whole time requirement has been met is this clear yes so what are we saying five and triggered output will give will first have this non overlap window there then there will be tccq and then there will be contamination delay of the combinational logic this should be sir it says the same before but only i think that should be a tiny yes this has got added so what has happened is that this contamination delay constraints if you can give more overlaps then contamination delay can be still smaller is this thing clear for the two phase latches so why the five one is after the fight to this window shouldn't be before i mean because it will come after also now how will i consider the whole time requirement of l2 because l2 sampling gets closed now i want input of l2 to be stable what will spoil the input of l of uh input of l2 the rising edge of phi 1 so the rising edge of phi 1 that comes after falling edge of phi 2 is what is i'm interested in is it not so but after the falling edge of phi 2 it will stop sampling right but there is a whole time requirement okay yes yes yes yes okay that is what i am interested in sir for building a faster circuit i will be i would like to decrease the increase the non overlapping non overlap is a dead period nothing is happening there non-overlap is a dead period no sampling could be happening you may actually be losing data because of known overlap the non-overlap benefit is that your whole time failures will not happen but i can have lower contamination delays yes because you have more margins there is no no there is increased non overlap duration okay now we come to mint delay for the pulse latches here what is the requirement we hold by this clock to kill plus the pulse width yes anna so over here pulse width gets added because for the entire direction of the pulse width there should be no change in the input over here are you able to see this so which is the sampling edge negative edge so you triggered the data from here and you want to define the whole time from here the negative that's why we are doing t plus plus tp okay yeah got that so sir hello yeah yeah so we also talked about this uh in the previous class also so this hold always would be higher so how would we justify it how will i justify using a puzzle before a flip-flop at anywhere if i use we will see what is the word so you have to look at other things also what is the sequencing overhead of a pulse latch as we come to time borrowing we will see what is the benefit of the loss there there are so many aspects the most important aspect is pulse flat is much denser than a flip flop it has much lesser number of devices than a flip flop so it consumes much lesser area lesser area means faster also lesser leakage also area is cold so if everything else is equivalent i still want to use bulk snatch yes you have a question yes sir so sir this pulsed clock is an internal clock of pulse latch so i have heard that we connected i set up and hold time at the original clock of the system yeah so why are we doing here at the place this particular system in this particular system this pulse this clock is in the shape of a pulse in this particular system that we are considering clock is coming as a pulse only the one that you have that one that you are referring to over there we are generating the pulse from the clock internally because that is how typical systems are in a typical system let us say in a typical system when you have to design an arm core or anything you cannot really have such short pulses however if you're designing a very specific system where you're using only latches all over the place and pulse latches are that then you may say that okay instead of having a pulse generator in every latch i would rather use a pulsed clock that is what we are talking about over here okay yeah raghav so can you just uh i'm not able to get the transitioning here so that for example the i'm consider for the whole time i will be considered transitioning the same transitioning at the l2 latch right yeah so sir uh this so for us for l2 what is the requirement so that after the falling edge uh my data should be stable for p hold yeah so from let us say it got triggered from the rising edge of l1 of clock at l1 yes sir so t ccq yes plus pcd of the combinational logic yes sir should be greater than 50 behold plus where is this t hole coming from not the rising edge of phi p but from the falling edge of ip so pulse width the sampling edge for a latch is falling edge yes sir that is where tpw gets added okay right okay is building this type of system uh not more risky because you cannot recover hold one shield yes they are more creative yes that is why they are not very commonly used but they are still used as we just discussed there is a benefit in area there is a benefit in overall leakage everything there is a benefit so okay we take some risk i will sign off more carefully said this uh i mean if you try to decrease the pulse width to uh to get a better hold hold requirement so in that case you will be kind of sending very very small spikes of clock yes that's a bigger challenge what is the smallest clock pulse that you can set that depends upon the setup as well why as i decrease the pulse width so setup will also be pushed back and back so it will set up save as i reduce the pulse rate the system will become more and more like a flop yes so what's the big deal i'm getting a flop kind of functionality at half the area but sending to the uh sending these pulses to distance would be like it will that be that is the challenge that i agree i'm not saying it is easy but there's a benefit a clear benefit there because the area is lesser this rc delay is due to which i cannot send signals or short pulses to long distances that also reduces yes so the pulse width also has to be greater than the c2q delay you really need that so because uh reducing the pulse width a lot smaller wasn't making the system work correctly yeah so is there a link to ccq that is what my question is or is there a link or do you need a minimum percent because of many other reasons or is it only ccq uh there can be many there but i i i noticed this that cq was always smaller than the minimum part built whatever they were using so the pulse pulse width was greater than c cq but i i'm not sure about this one that is a representation they have made in the diagrams don't don't read too much into it these diagrams are not to time so now let's look at skew what happens when q is added flip flops you already done so uh skew gets added as overhead there simple huh for whole time again you will have to assume that skew is to be taken care of in the contamination delay thing so the upper one is negative screw and lower one is positive skew right in both the cases we have said that q is positive we are as of now in this particular equation keeping skew as positive if the skew is negative the value of t square will count negative automatically okay okay okay if you don't take that sign then we'll have to,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EczTGsbBEKA,"Link:

Transcript: here okay okay sir yeah so now about the whole time contamination delays what would you say about this we already discussed the flops the contamination [Music] contamination delay should

count negative automatically okay okay okay if you don't take that sign then we'll have to"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,PFnj7GYe-cM,okay so we have to take a sign in there okay now we come to this concept of time borrowing what is time borrowing see in a flop based system data is launched on one rising edge and it should be set up before the next rising edge on the next flop am i right yes yes sir now if it arrives late the system would fail but if it arrives early we know that there is some extra margin left so time is getting wasted anna now consider a large base system the data need not limit itself at the rising edge it can pass through while the latch is transparent entire duration and the logic which is very long can actually borrow timing so since the flop is this since the latch is transparent for the entire let us say positive duration and samples only here i have this extra margin so there is some setup time requirement this extra margin for my data to evaluate of the data of the previous combinational logic to evaluate are you able to see this we saw it in all the equations till now the setup time has we have much more relax on setup time with the in the latch based system and all the equations that we saw we saw that there is a benefit of pulse width that appears when i have to define the setup time meet the setup time requirements so we can overall gain through such a system if we say that uh my this combinational logic is a little longer so this kind of completes after the next phase has even started this combinational logic also completes after the next phase has started let us say so what what are we doing we are borrowing time across boundaries are you able to see this hello some feedback friends so what do we mean by that we are borrowing timing across the boundary so let us consider instead of a latch there was a flop here yes sir could you have slid after the clock cycle clock rising edge no sir so that is what we are meaning by bowering borrowing okay so why we are not like considering the define the clock period as from the falling edge to the falling edge itself no and the rising is from the rising edge then we're seeing that time borrowing is there so we're defining clock period from rising h to rising edge only so yes i'm sensing the y only so we can define it from the falling issue following it then this time boring thing won't we have to consider like separately we can directly do analysis that way no for a for a positive edge triggered latch uh uh the convention is we do it from positive to positive if you can do it from negative negative then the same challenge would come for the negative level triggered latch battery okay now look at the b part down there if there is a loop that is coming into picture then there is a constraint on overall timing are you able to see this so if there was no loop we were simply cascading across the entire system then i would always borrow from the next cycle but if there is a loop and i have borrowed combinational logic delay from here into the second phase then the second phase tpd has to be shorter only i would not have the flexibility to now borrow from this stage itself because already are you able to see this for loops the entire propagation delay should be managed within the clock period if there are no loops i can continue to borrow from subsequent cycles so so what kind of loop are you considering i mean this little thing any loop something happened and you want to give feedback and therefore change the state machine in a different way any loop in the system feedback loops okay i know so if there's a loop then i should make sure that my second stage looking after phi 2 my combination logic should be as small as possible another way within this constraint time which i am given yes okay i know so how much can we borrow natural question is how much can we borrow can i really make it so long that that there is no no no no problem anywhere so we just said that we have to ensure that set of time from the falling edge of clock has to be met is it not so how much can i borrow i can borrow you know if in case of two phase latches i have to borrow like this in case of pulse latches it depends on the pulse width if my pulse width is very small it's in the case of pulsars the perfect is very small then all this is all that i can borrow are you able to see this so pulse latches it is almost uh nothing that you can do yes but if the pulse is big enough then you can see look at it like this if i had it been a flop had it been a flop you would not have been able to borrow anything you would have to ensure that whatever happened it was uh before you know there was this entire set time that you had to be worried about before the rising edge of clock when you have a pulse latch because sampling happens at the falling edge you have this margin so at least benefit but yeah the pulse is very small because that is what we want it to be then that gain is not very significant but there is still some gain some borrowing is still happening or is possible which is absolutely impossible for a flop okay yes sir sir this borrowing time we are constraining it from the first combinational logic but if you look at the second combination logic then we'll have to constrain it from the old side because the combination is getting smaller on that the side logic is smaller than the second combination again as you're absolutely right set up and hold you have to always take care of so non-overlapping should be sufficient enough right yes to avoid those combinational logic things the whole time failures you can increase the non overlaps okay so uh what happens if there is a setup violation in a in a clock system so the setups are violated you reduce the clock speed but if the whole times are violated to fail at fails at any speed to get working chips is the most important requirement you know you want system to be functional on silicon and a way to guarantee non-ho like that whole time failures do not happen is have two phase latches with big non overlap times exactly the same point we were discussing just so that is the benefit of using latches and two-phase clocking but but sir in case we are using two-phase latches even if the chip kind of fails i can increase the normally if i am globally giving the clock yes that is where at least with the two-phase lap system you have a flexibility if you can somehow control the non-overlap period you have the flexibility to recover from a whole failure also provided you had some margins and set up yes so since we're talking about failures we can talk of a safe flip-flop also where we say that we will use two phases of clock see that in the flop we were using one phase of clock only we just saw that by using non overlap systems or by using two phase latches we can have a system which would be robust even in the presence of a whole time failure so can we draw a flop which is safe at all times where there are no hold time failures possible because of non overlaps but we should realize that this non overlap leads to slowing down the system as i was mentioning earlier also that no non overlap is a kind of dead time so it slows down the entire system because it adds to the setup time requirement are you with me great then,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFnj7GYe-cM,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFnj7GYe-cM

should realize that this non overlap leads to slowing down the system as i was mentioning earlier also that no non overlap is a kind of dead time so it slows down the entire system because it adds to the setup time requirement are you with me great then"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,G4NA-k88Ys4,so that system is working designers have to leave timing margins for voltage so this is pvt variations so even if your your final silicon is designed typical is manufactured on a typical lot you know that you have already left margins for slow slow lot am i right because you did the sta across entire lots the design is same there could be extra margins that are left for close to a lot for the setup time thing and extra margins left for whole for fast fast slot for the whole thing so designers end up using lots of for leaving lots of margins so that the entire pvt range and you know data dependency or tool and accuracies are well taken care of so what happens even if your manufactured silicon could probably operate at 600 megahertz because you had designed for a slow lot what happens you had to design the system only at 450 megahertz the system cannot operate faster than 450. that's what the challenge is are you able to see this any questions on this part so to correct this type of thing we studied that adaptive voltage scaling we can do something like that adaptive voltage scaling was for different loads different loads means different operational loads but i am over here now talking only of let us say uh sign off at 1.1 volt okay so we cannot change the voltage yes if i am signing off at 1.1 volt then i have lost the frequency there am i right now at 1.1 i am saying don't operate faster than 450 megahertz whereas the silicon that was manufactured could actually have much higher throughput yes so i'm losing for all you know uh in a overall distribution uh lots which are considered slow could only be 20 of the total lots but because of those 20 the remaining 80 percent are also operating slow are not able to give the maximum frequency at which they could operate so the alternative is that you say that okay we'll run faster we'll run faster for everyone now only if there are systems which are failing only if there is a failure we will slow down the frequency so then only in those 20 lots which were slow you are slowing down the frequency the remaining you are operating at 600 megahertz but how do you know that there is going to be a failure at 600 megahertz so for this you use two schemes tannery and razor so do you know what canaries are so so so for the sta we are taking the slow slope pvt corners yes that is the challenge you are mentioning yeah but though i could be operating though my device could be manufactured different ff or typical table conor yeah okay so this is kind of categorization that you are doing like we were talking in the first go in the right direction what i'm saying is that my system could operate at a higher frequency but i am i have constrained it because of my sign of voltage huh how can i remove those constraints so i say okay my system will generate an error signal as soon as there is a failure whenever there is a failure i will reduce the voltage or i will reduce the frequency of operation so this could be used in adaptive systems also where if i say that i have a system which is operating at say 500 megahertz you designed the system and you said okay slow lot works at 450 megahertz at 1.1 volt now your system was designed as typical so it could actually operate at 600 megahertz you wanted to use dvfs dbss we discussed dvfs some time back what is dvfs yes sir we dynamically scale the voltage and frequency load on the processor we said we will reduce the voltage and we will reduce the frequency so i want to do dvfs so i want to reduce from 1.1 volts to let us say 1.0 volts as i do that i may continue to operate at 450 megahertz only and i may find that even at 1.0 volt my system is operational at 450 megahertz simply because it was designed on typical can it happen yes it is so i do not i continue with the same high throughput for as long as possible even though my voltage has lowered so my power consumption has reduced i am giving a different kind of use cases where if i could generate an error signal to tell that oh now my frequency needs to be reduced i can start to gain more from the system are you able to see this these examples are able to understand these examples in terms of timing and i will stop scaling them yes i will start to reduce the frequency of operation then or i will stop i will stop further voltage lowering then okay raghav uh i mean voltage lowering is not considered here right i just give an example of voltage lowering also now so but you said nikki we are giving you different examples okay one example was uh where i said that okay even at 1.1 i could operate at 600 megahertz i will operate only those guys which given a error at 450 others i will operate at 600 that was one example then i said another use case could be that okay 450 megahertz is the speed that i need at 1.1 no problems but i want to reduce power so what do i do i reduce the voltage of operation until i see a failure so instead of 1.1 on a typical lot i will operate at 1.0 or until i see an error so this is called as adaptive voltage scaling frequency has not scaled but voltage has killed so that i could recover leakage and having such canaries or razors in my circuit can help me generate these error flags so what is a canary i come back to my question what is a canary how many of you know no one knows the canary i that dictionary says it is a bird sorry yeah so canary is a very small bird so it's another very sweet musical sound so you know when uh when miners would go into coal mines they would take tanneries along with them these canneries would entertain them throughout the day they would just chirp their song along and they would entertain them throughout the day but entertainment was not the only reason of taking canaries with them into those coal mines see there is the coal mines there is a very big risk the risk is that there could be a fire due to which carbon monoxide levels can increase and uh all the people in the mine can get fixated and die anna so they took calories along tanneries would sing along and they would entertain them but if by chance carbon monoxide levels in the mind would increase tanneries are very small delicate birds they die as soon as carbon monoxide levels increase they're very sensitive to carbon monoxide so as soon as the canary would stop would die the song would stop and everyone knows there is a risk of a fixation they would just evacuate the mine so why are we what is a canary circuit then there is some kind of views okay so calories are circuits which are more sensitive than your actual circuit so if your actual circuit has a timing slack at time of sign off if it has a margin of let us say 100 picosecond the canary circuit that you will put in your system will have a margin of only 50 per second so if somehow delays increase because you lowered the voltages because as you lower the voltage delays would increase the margins on the calorie circuits would reduce or become zero or become negative before margins on actual circuits so canaries would fail first as soon as canary fails you have the error signal and you can stop further lowering are you able to see this yes now then what is razor it's a rate it sounds like it will cut apart all the scaling system so razer stands for razor edge very sharp see with canary what happens i said my minimum margin was 100 per second so i designed my canary with a margin of 50 pico seconds what this also means is that for all the paths for even for those paths for which margin was 500 pico seconds my canary would fail much earlier it could happen it could happen that my uh how do i say it could happen that my critical path which is active as of now had a margin of 500 picoseconds so even at lower voltage it would not have failed i am supposed using only an adder not a multiplier so adder can actually operate at a lower voltage without any failure but my canary because it was designed for the multiplier canary failed can it happen so now i am not able to gain further power recover further power so that is when razor comes in razer says that ok i will check your exact circuit and i will compare it with the delayed version of my signal so only the delayed version is different from the actual one which i have lashed i will say there is another if the delayed is same that means there is no error it's something like what we were discussing earlier in the day where we said that after contamination delay the signal is stable yes that particular signal is stable but the entire signal output may not be stable so what we are looking is when we talking about razor is for every shift resistor for example we could have a sensor which says that okay are the contents of my razor when i sampled different from the contents say hundred picoseconds later if the contents are different you say oh i have sampled something wrong otherwise you say wow i sampled everything correctly let's move ahead and do the next set of calculations you have a question so are these two doing uh doing uh doing doing the same thing like they are generating an error in that sense they are doing the same thing but at the time of designing the philosophy is very different for canary you are making the slowest possible circuit for razer you are not doing any such circuit redesign you are simply sampling the circuit again okay and both these are to basically see what is the edge of my performance is like how fast you can go so this so canaries are not much in fact today because the kind of margins that you have to leave the gains that you can get from canary are not significant but razer is something on which some sufficient amount of research is continuing to happen to make it you know proactively available in in industrial designs uh so if you would want to you know know more about it you will see that there are papers on razors you know improvement in the original razer idea and all that even in very recent years in fact our group has also published some papers on razer over the past some a few people are working on razor techniques even now in this semester your seniors are working on laser techniques so uh this is an area of active research adaptive sequencing and if you're interested you could probably do some projects in the next year this eraser it would be complex right other otherwise i could build that eraser by using some offers and that is why research is happening now that is what we want to simplify can you just give a brief of what what sort of circuits do we use in this razor so razors simply simply or usually require redesign of a flop so that there is an extra latch on the flop the extra latch samples that after some delay only so the data has come the extra the the the output will be latched twice once on the clock edge once on a delayed clock edge if both the data are same you say great if they are different then you say there's an error so it's a much bigger flop that we have when we use razer yes okay so in this razor thing uh the sampling can i for example just for the simply simple understanding can i say that the different intervals the minimum sampling that could be the difference between like uh the between the contamination and the propagation delay uh how you define that margin you know that is not really dependent on contamination and propagation right that's how designers what kind of margin you want to leave that is what defines that okay okay okay so but like in physical implementation that is the kind of the thing that is i can't comment on that there is no such rule okay okay but ultimately it is because that uh sampling ultimately i'm saying that even my data would be stable yeah uh and the earliest at the earliest when my data will be stable so i'm talking about propagation delay data is stable yes sir okay but they connection doesn't come into picture okay okay but there could be different uh variation in that propagation delay itself okay okay okay so yes so uh i'm i want to ask about this razor thing sir you told the data in the clock cycle and the skewed clock cycle will be evaluated and then some kind of xor thing would be done to check i think is it something like that yes and one more thing i wanted to ask that uh there are some universal time constraints that are related to every latches and flip flops like you said the setup should be should not be five percent of the minimum so these and also let's say the pulse width this mainly depends upon the drive drive strength of our uh means internal circuits of the lightning flip flop and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4NA-k88Ys4,"Link:

Transcript: so that system is working designers have to leave timing margins for voltage so this is pvt variations so even if your your final silicon is designed typical is manufactured on a typical lot you know that you have already left margins for slow slow lot am i right because you did the sta across entire lots the design is same there could be extra margins that are left for close to a lot for the setup time thing and extra margins left for whole for fast fast slot for the whole thing so designers end up using lots of for leaving lots of margins so that the entire pvt range and you know data dependency or tool and accuracies are well taken care of so what happens even if your manufactured silicon could probably operate at 600 megahertz because you had designed for a slow lot what happens you had to design the system only at 450 megahertz the system cannot operate faster than 450. that's what the challenge is are you able to see this any questions on this part so to correct this type of thing we studied that adaptive voltage scaling we can do something like that adaptive voltage scaling was for different loads different loads means different operational loads but i am over here now talking only of let us say uh sign off at 1.1 volt okay so we cannot change the voltage yes if i am signing off at 1.1 volt then i have lost the frequency there am i right now at 1.1 i am saying don't operate faster than 450 megahertz whereas the silicon that was manufactured could actually have much higher throughput yes so i'm losing for all you know uh in a overall distribution uh lots which are considered slow could only be 20 of the total lots but because of those 20 the remaining 80 percent are also operating slow are not able to give the maximum frequency at which they could operate so the alternative is that you say that okay we'll run faster we'll run faster for everyone now only if there are systems which are failing only if there is a failure we will slow down the frequency so then only in those 20 lots which were slow you are slowing down the frequency the remaining you are operating at 600 megahertz but how do you know that there is going to be a failure at 600 megahertz so for this you use two schemes tannery and razor so do you know what canaries are so so so for the sta we are taking the slow slope pvt corners yes that is the challenge you are mentioning yeah but though i could be operating though my device could be manufactured different ff or typical table conor yeah okay so this is kind of categorization that you are doing like we were talking in the first go in the right direction what i'm saying is that my system could operate at a higher frequency but i am i have constrained it because of my sign of voltage huh how can i remove those constraints so i say okay my system will generate an error signal as soon as there is a failure whenever there is a failure i will reduce the voltage or i will reduce the frequency of operation so this could be used in adaptive systems also where if i say that i have a system which is operating at say 500 megahertz you designed the system and you said okay slow lot works at 450 megahertz at 1.1 volt now your system was designed as typical so it could actually operate at 600 megahertz you wanted to use dvfs dbss we discussed dvfs some time back what is dvfs yes sir we dynamically scale the voltage and frequency load on the processor we said we will reduce the voltage and we will reduce the frequency so i want to do dvfs so i want to reduce from 1.1 volts to let us say 1.0 volts as i do that i may continue to operate at 450 megahertz only and i may find that even at 1.0 volt my system is operational at 450 megahertz simply because it was designed on typical can it happen yes it is so i do not i continue with the same high throughput for as long as possible even though my voltage has lowered so my power consumption has reduced i am giving a different kind of use cases where if i could generate an error signal to tell that oh now my frequency needs to be reduced i can start to gain more from the system are you able to see this these examples are able to understand these examples in terms of timing and i will stop scaling them yes i will start to reduce the frequency of operation then or i will stop i will stop further voltage lowering then okay raghav uh i mean voltage lowering is not considered here right i just give an example of voltage lowering also now so but you said nikki we are giving you different examples okay one example was uh where i said that okay even at 1.1 i could operate at 600 megahertz i will operate only those guys which given a error at 450 others i will operate at 600 that was one example then i said another use case could be that okay 450 megahertz is the speed that i need at 1.1 no problems but i want to reduce power so what do i do i reduce the voltage of operation until i see a failure so instead of 1.1 on a typical lot i will operate at 1.0 or until i see an error so this is called as adaptive voltage scaling frequency has not scaled but voltage has killed so that i could recover leakage and having such canaries or razors in my circuit can help me generate these error flags so what is a canary i come back to my question what is a canary how many of you know no one knows the canary i that dictionary says it is a bird sorry yeah so canary is a very small bird so it's another very sweet musical sound so you know when uh when miners would go into coal mines they would take tanneries along with them these canneries would entertain them throughout the day they would just chirp their song along and they would entertain them throughout the day but entertainment was not the only reason of taking canaries with them into those coal mines see there is the coal mines there is a very big risk the risk is that there could be a fire due to which carbon monoxide levels can increase and uh all the people in the mine can get fixated and die anna so they took calories along tanneries would sing along and they would entertain them but if by chance carbon monoxide levels in the mind would increase tanneries are very small delicate birds they die as soon as carbon monoxide levels increase they're very sensitive to carbon monoxide so as soon as the canary would stop would die the song would stop and everyone knows there is a risk of a fixation they would just evacuate the mine so why are we what is a canary circuit then there is some kind of views okay so calories are circuits which are more

reduce or become zero or become negative before margins on actual circuits so canaries would fail first as soon as canary fails you have the error signal and you can stop further lowering are you able

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,bMuk48cJnPA,what are the arithmetic circuits by the way what do you understand by the term arithmetic circuits you've seen the slides the slides were already put online how many of you have seen the sites by the way i've been putting them online in advance but how many of you have seen them you can just raise your hand and i will know okay so out of 40 around six people have fifteen percent seven people fifteen percent of the class let us say okay not bad so uh what are the arithmetic circuits actually you should be able to respond so for performing arithmetic operations we need editors and subtractors all these things so these are the arithmetic good and when we talk of these adders and subtract subtractors and multipliers what is the most important thing that we need to be you know looking for so one thing is the logically correct circuit other thing is that uh we need to make sure that in a fixed amount of delays we get some output for example if the carry is propagating over the over the adders then it should be coming in some defined worst case dealing that should be the most critical part of it and you want to reduce that worst case delay it's not just that you late i but it's also that you want to reduce that first case delay am i right okay so deepansi i see your hand raised did you raise it when i asked about the slides or do you have a question no sir about the slides okay so you can lower your hand just give me a minute sure so arithmetic circuits are very commonly used wherever you have a processor for example you know this is a typical or a very top-level view of a processor where you would have some data paths and a memory inputs and outputs and a control part and in this data path you will have you know for example what is called as adders multipliers shifters comparators etc all of that the control part would have finite state machines counters and so these are the different components that you will see in this digital digital processor let us say memories and interconnects with arbitration units and buses and switches and so on so in this lecture we are spent we are intending to spend time on arithmetic circuits in the next lecture we will be spending time on memory circuits okay again this is just a top level glimpse and this is in by no way an intent to make you an expert on adders or multipliers or even memories if you want to do learn more about memories i would suggest take up the memory design course in the next semester for adders multipliers take up a capstone project or a another project like that where you can study more about them and design them if uh you know if you wish to so that would be a preferred mode of learning more about arithmetic circuits in terms of address multipliers and the like okay so uh a typical data path you know for example if i say that there is a 64-bit processor over here i have shown a 4-bit processor so a typical data path is uh so if i say there are 64 bits in a processor then what could be done it could be that a a bit would enter over here there is a 32-bit adder here uh there is a 32-bit multiplier here so the bit would go all like this this a circuit just route but any bit can take any word can't take but that is not really optimal so what is typically done is that data paths are designed as bit slices so over here you will have let us say a 0 b 0 going in and that will result in the output b0 uh o0 let us put it as o0 okay the next slice would have a1 and b1 going in and the final output would be o1 so they are organized and arranged in such a way that data flow is kind of streamlined it's it's fast it doesn't waste time in neither interconnects or other stuff and in your data path you that is how you include registers and adders and multipliers and shifters and everything there if some particular function is not required on a data that particular block is simply skipped by bypass and you run out okay so a slightly complex stuff you know would mean that in addition to just multiplexes and shifters you could actually have adders implemented also in stages in the sense that if you look at the previous slide we said adder is one stage shifter is another stage however in this slide what i'm saying is that an adder just so that you have a fast addition possible may be split into multiple stages and you may have one stage of adder over here second stage and third stage as you move on and but they're all in terms of bit slices only this is bit slice zero this is bit slice one and the like are you able to see this any questions still here sir is it just to enable more parallelism right uh anyway if you have to add 32 bits you have to add 32-bit so there has to be some parallelism in there we will as we look into the address just ask about addressing when we will start to look into the adders you will see what i mean by address stage 1 either stage 2 and other stage three we will talk about tree adders and that is where this this concept will become more evident but uh yeah you're in in a data path you're processing all the different bits in parallel there could be interconnects between them for example we showed that if you if you notice over here we are showing that there is this some output from bit 0 going to some other bit some output from bit 0 going to another bit somewhere in the data path so there could be some such interconnects also okay uh but they are running in parallel largely they are running in parallel okay answer what is this loop that must uh this is uh information going back saying that okay there is an overflow or there is uh so system level bus it is which which would give information to close any loops that were there no okay now addition is completed so you can accept the next input it could be ready signal that could be those things okay yes so what are shifter what are shifters shifters are shift resistors where you the number of clock cycles you give it will just rotate the like barrel shifters they will just rotate the word in there so shifter could be used to manage the pipeline stages if we give serial input and we take parallel output so anything like that uh shifter is a set of flip flops so in those terms uh you can think of using them as a scan chain also yes uh no problem with that but shifters barrel shifters are not just for for pipeline power shifters are barrel shifters which could be a part of say multiplication and division also yes ranjit uh sir so basically this bit uh big slice represents the complete data path right for one bit but how can we just be sure that in a particular architecture the data path for suppose if you have n uh bit slices then all the n-bit slices are identical it's not very they may not be they may not be in this case it says you've taken bit zero output of adder stage one and we have merged it or taken it to taken it as an input to let us say bit slice seven okay then in the second second wiring stage we've taken the output of bit 0 into something like bit 55 i know so need not be we're not saying they are symmetrical what we are saying is data path is in one flow okay this is just to streamline so that when you design you do not also uh you know have errors end up end up with errors because of some confusion or interconnects because when we will see just a little while later tree adders you will see there are so complex interconnects but it's better to separate it like this okay sir okay rajneesh sir in the previous slide in the bit slide bit slice design separate register was given in a bit slide but in this one in this diagram there is no separate register means in the bit slice yeah so you if you if you look at the previous slide they were adding that resistor to latch the incoming data that's fine there are two different architectures they would these guys would uh in the second bit slice over here uh possibly they're already saying that if this is coming from a register file is it not here it has considered it as a common one yeah it is coming from a register file already so we do not need to register it again yes and one more thing sir sorry in this you said that this bit slices of one bit but sorry in previous slide uh it is a four bit uh bit slice no this is a bit slice oh okay so here okay yes yeah okay anything else so just just a clarification sir if if i have a bit slice let's say if it is a it is a very very simple circuit of a mux so in a bit slice we can say that uh many out and output of many bit slices can converge into a single a single one like in a multiplexer many inputs are there there is only one out uh not necessary it could be that i have four inputs coming for every multiplexer and those four inputs are available separately for all the bits and i select just one out of those happens now so it could happen that my let us say my data path is just for the sake of area i redo i kept the data power back 16 bits but my total words were 64 bits now there is a data path of 16 bits but my overall word width is 64. so what would i do i would organize my words in such a way that words 0 to 15 are processed in the first cycle then word 16 to 31 are processed in the second cycle then word 32 to 47 are processed in the third cycle and so on aging kind of thing uh paging yes could be but there could be more than one inputs coming to the multiplexer at the level of the multiplexer which then is conversion to one and then the entire shifter adder stage one etcetera goes

said that this bit slices of one bit but sorry in previous slide uh it is a four bit uh bit slice no this is a bit slice oh okay so here okay yes yeah okay anything else so just just a clarification sir if if i have a bit slice let's say if it is a it is a very very simple circuit of a mux so in a bit slice we can say that uh many out and output of many bit slices can converge into a single a single one like in a multiplexer many inputs are there there is only one out uh not necessary it could be that i have four inputs coming for every multiplexer and those four inputs are available separately for all the bits and i select just one out of those happens now so it could happen that my let us say my data path is just for the sake of area i redo i kept the data power back 16 bits but my total words were 64 bits now there is a data path of 16 bits but my overall word width is 64. so what would i do i would organize my words in such a way that words 0 to 15 are processed in the first cycle then word 16 to 31 are processed in the second cycle then word 32 to 47 are processed in the third cycle and so on aging kind of thing uh paging yes could be but there could be more than one inputs coming to the multiplexer at the level of the multiplexer which then is conversion to one and then the entire shifter adder stage one etcetera goes on"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,OiDXtgAKLU0,yes Okay so this is one photograph of a of a data path hardened data path and you will notice that it is not really symmetrical for all bits as it was saying it is not really symmetrical for all bits but yeah it's fine so we come into adders now what is an adder or are you able to see this functionality this truth table can you validate this is a correct truth table for the adder so what's this carrying status in which delete and propagate and generate are like that's a different thing are you able to validate the otherwise came up yes sir yes yes sir so now let us look at the last column what is Carry status so let us say that uh there was the inputs A and B were both zero hmm then independent of CI what will happen to co will be 0. are you able to see this yes sir now if either of A or B was one if either of them was one do you realize that whatever be the carry in it will be propagated further hello yes sir yes and when both A and B are 1 then again whatever we the CN C how it is definitely one are able to see this also yes sir so this is what we want to say or this is what this delete delete means whatever with the CN C out will be 0. propagate means whatever with the CN that will be propagated on C out generate means whatever be the same C out will be 1. are you able to see this yes so that is what Carry status means this this becomes important as we will look at uh uh implementation a typical or a very basic implementation of the slider would appear to be something like this that s is equal to 1 so we what we do we look at this this K map and we start to say okay it is or there is a one over here no no sorry we say okay my S is one over here then it is 1 over here and one over here and my C out is one over here and here so you you start to merge and you start to see if you could have K Maps uh being used to arrive at a logic and when you do that you arrive at this kind of a k map that s is one then either of these four Constructors one and see how it is one then either of these constructs is equal to 1. this is how you you must have done adders earlier also this is a simple adder full adder huh so we say that okay in the same order we we have used a b and c and then we have used inverts of B and inverse of c and inverse of a to make our logic of s so probably I will need a lot of gates to do it can I do it simpler so we say okay there was this information of delete propagate and generate at least that much I can use for generating carry out so we say that okay we express sum and carry as a function of propagate generate and delete only where carry out can be can be uh represented are represented as a sum of G Plus PCI be propagate a propagate is one then whatever is the CI comes on there or carry generated either carry generated or carries propagated and therefore CI becomes C out and S is that my propagate should be one it's a czar of propagate and CI in fact uh just to make our logic a little simpler use lesser number of devices many times you will use propagate as a or b because in A or B situation also whatever is the CN whenever CN has one you will propagate that are you able to see this see for C out I already have G there that is if a and b both are 1 I will have G equal to 1. so if c i was 0 in that case also I could say that let me use propagate as one because C out will be given as 1 from here generate generate part itself so many times just to make a logic simpler we may want to use propagate as a or b instead of a is or B so what is a plus b we could have said this from the truth table also from the truth table it is not really a plus b look at it uh if it was a plus b then uh in one one would also result in the yes this would have resulted in propagate but this has resulted in generate henna um that is not the case so in in actual terms it is generate but even if you call it propagate it doesn't matter because the co has to be generated the CI has CI will be one there I know because of generate you have used the variable as a or b a a and b so A and B are one so C of C naught can happen already are you able to see this yes so can you please like I got confused in this part why we are using uh two expressions for a propagate so you use only one expression A or B okay so but why why we are using two here I understood your point that I can use one and I'll get the functionality done but why two why to do it why two values of propagate two by expression for propagates see the exact expression is a is or B but we said that even if we use the expression of a or b yes sir C naught and S will not be different given this expression G is equal to C is caught is equal to g plus PCI and S is equal to P is our c i so these two outputs will still remain same even if I use propagate as a or b but or gate is much simpler than as or gate yeah yes that is why okay okay thank you take care yes so here it is written uh can also be expressed by a sum and Carry Out can also be expressed in terms of D and P yeah but I think instead of using D if we use G it would be more I think I think when you will Implement by using D two more inverter should be required right uh you see but you will need inverse of a and b s but uh just work it out it is not saying this is the minimum the the one with D and P will be the minimum gate implementation it says if you have dnp available with you even then you can Implement test and see now what it essentially intends to communicate is you need to do either of generate you need to do either generate or kill don't need to do both yes yes so even though we want we want to express some and carry as functions of PG and d p and either G or D will work for us yes okay that's the intent over here so now that was one bit adder if we have to make a four bit Adder what do we do we simply just say Okay this C out of bit 0 is C enough bit one and see out of one is C in of bit 2 and so on so what happens uh once the C out of 0 is generated it goes as seen of the second act full adder then third full adder then fourth full adder and then you get the output so what is happening I am Rippling the carry from one full adder to another and what is the uh worst case delay if as I increase the number of bits the number of hops increases linearly and therefore this is order n and what we also understand is that carry in to carry out paths should be as fast as possible are you able to see this these two aspects um yes sir so now if we go ahead and you know try to implement that full adder which this functionality in terms of a CMOS logic you would get a 28 transistor implementation something like this so you can you can do it at your on leisurely time where you will see that this is G A and B and then this is uh C and A or B hmm so this is your C out and similarly you will get your sum also based on by implementing whatever logic we had given there is this clear yes sir uh so in the last slide I have a question yes so here T Adder equal to n minus 1 T carry plus T some third just T some student it will be maximum of 3 sum and T Theory uh exactly the right to have the same understanding so let us look at this path uh what happens you realize that a b and everything was stable already these parts are stable already is it not when your carry came what what require what was required to be done when your carry came you only need to evaluate these parts of the gate Hannah so uh and you notice that CI has been kept as close to the output as possible so that the delay from C to out is minimum that is the delay mentioned as C sum or t sum whereas from a to sum or B to sum the delay could be slightly higher okay so already we have decreased the delays internally from from carry 2. from carry 2 yes so uh there is a different delay for generating a carry that is evident because delay to generator carry is this path delay to generate a sum is this path you know so this sum depends upon the voltage at node X which is also one of the inputs so it constitutes this entire path for next two years so yeah that can cause more delay for us than CO2 yeah done okay so what is also now important to see is that if you have a adder then you could actually have a invert Adder also there so what has happened over here you have a full adder over here you have inverted all the inputs and you say okay your output should also be inverted so S Bar of avci is equal to sum of a bar B Bar C A by CI bar and so on by using this inversion property what do you do you say okay I will not I will at least not use this inverter this one we may have to use but at least Joe C naught you see how generate currently inverter I can avoid using that and I would have see out going directly to the inverted full adder the next one I will have a regular full adder and then and again an inverted full adder so if you do it like this then what happens the total number of transistors in your system reduces because you don't need to put those additional inverters at the end of it so there are two things that are evident that there is a focus on reducing delay and then there is a focus on reducing area also because this is a large number of devices 28 transistors so we want the delay to be less but we want this number of devices also to be less so that is where figures in this mirror adder where you will see that the nmos and the pmos parts are kind of mirrors of each other and again uh the the circuit works fine where you say that okay you give CI from here and you get Co Sea House Bar and you get S Bar as outputs there Tigger so you can at at your own Leisure evaluate that this is this works fine this is fine for uh the functionality that you want to achieve for both C naught and S so but this uh this particular topology will be uh valid only if you have even number of stages right sir if you have odd number of stages then once again we need to add inverter at the subject and that we can just add on the last inverter last stage yes so this one inverter will come not it will not come 25 times yes sir so that we can always dominate appropriately so what are we talking about so for the mirror error for example we are saying that what you've done is the nmos and pmo stacks are completely symmetrical they are very similar to each other and uh I think from the discussion that we have had till now you must have already realized that the load on C out or the capacitances linked to generation of C out should be kept as low as possible why is that why should the capacitance is linked to generation of cob kept as low as possible because the carry has to propagate through the stages of Adder yes because the carry out of your state will go to the next stage then again the entire carry out will be new carry out will be generated for the next stage and so on at least if the propagation is going to happen so that is what we are looking at that we have to reduce the capacitances also we have to reduce the delays as you reduce the capacitances power and delay will automatically reduce hmm is that clear okay then see we looked at that what we looked at just now was a ripple Adder where data would you know move from a carry outward move from here to here to here finally giving a carry out three it's a very long path see the sum path is very short is very long especially if you have large number of bits so you will see that in the next few slides they're all we're just talking about how to anticipate the carry so one way is bypass the evaluations of uh C out for all these stages simply see if the overall P0 P1 P2 P3 are all one if they're all one then what you say is that okay since all the propagates are one then whatever was there on CI will definitely come on C out also are you with me any questions so we are saying is all the propagate servers so the uh the input carry will be reflected at the output directly yeah that we have studied okay yes hello so uh if we do it like that then what happens we have carry bypass for uh first four bits then we have carry bypass for the next four bits then we have carry bypass for the next four bits and so on so if there are total number of embeds then what is the total delay of the adder you will see the total delay of the adder would reduce would reduce such that uh you will have uh n divided by m minus 1. so the total number of delays that you will now need to see is what is the critical path the critical path would be something like this Hannah so would the largest delay also decrease just the largest delay yes it would decrease because uh earlier like uh it would decrease if you're using the propagate and kill valid topology because if you're not using propagate and kelvala thing then what happens is that all a b and c n will be calculated from Top dot top bottom and then we will arrive somewhere at sum and Carry Out however because you are using propagate and generate thing you already know what the C out could be uh much faster you don't need to evaluate after this comes you know what is the status of PNG the multiplexer inputs are already set and you either propagate or regenerate so it says time we'll see how it saves time further also but this saves time because now your Ripple is only for M number of bits so you'll see initially it appears that when the total number of bits is very less a bypass Adder because of its uh more complex logic and a multiplexer in there and so on may take a little extra delay however when you're talking about large number of bits say 32 64 128 or so on then Ripple Larry is much much slower than bypass Adder right and it is a consequence of these equations only nothing else okay any questions sir in the previous slides someone slider yeah can you explain this n by m minus one t by bus term once again okay so let us say this is 16 bit Adder Hannah this is 16-bit order how many bypass would it take would it pass through so first before that how many bits how many bits in one stage four hello yes sir so if you have a data Adder coming or set of inputs coming from here this this is the while this is being evaluated this part of data would have already been ready yes sir similarly here things would already be ready yes so when you are uh when you want to find the total delay what are you looking at setup delay plus carry generation delay Plus number of these that will be there n by m minus 1 so actually n by M minus 1 over here you can see so we know that okay 16 bits have been brought into have been split into four bits each so we would have of 4 minus one n by n by m 2 8 may be a parallel T by passes the delay of let us say this multiplexer yes yes because yes yes uh sir in case in all the bit 0 to 3 4 7 8 to 11 and 12 to 15. if this condition is not satisfied that p 0 P 1 p 2 p 3 is equal to one then in that case none of the carry would be directly going uh without without facing the carry propocational so if the propagations are not all all ones if the propagates are not all ones then what happens when you anyway do not be you will not be Rippling the carry to the entire path so your overall delay will actually be lesser only whatever was evaluated here earlier would already be valid we are talking about the worst case delay where you say okay the Ripple has to happen through the entire system hmm because if there is some p p and g equal to 0 at some bit whichever bit it is then it means that the evaluation that was done for higher bits than this were already clean because c c n was anyway 0 and it will remain zero it will not change it oh yes so as you increase the total number of bits you see that bypass Adder has much better performance than Ripple Adder but it has much more circuit also in there to be able to do all these through the automatic like so there is a setup circuit and so on which would be there ranjith you have a question oh yes sir in the previous slide okay sir I understood how we get the teacher M times the T carry uh plus uh n by m minus 1 times the T bypass but why once again we have M minus 1 times the T carries this this one I didn't understand Okay so all right let me show the variables are different this is this variable is MP carry and this variable is M minus 1 and 2 T Curry okay but y m minus 1 into 3 T carries but I didn't understand because always if we consider one single bypass stage the carry generation will happen parallely for all of them so and then we'll like uh bypass this for the first for the first stage that carry generation you have to still count now eight bar two you will have to count okay then you add the delays of uh various ones and for this one and it says there are if there are M bits then that would mean M minus 1 times Ripple could happen at least in this one is it not even for a four bit thing even for a 4-bit thing if the carry has to be generated like this every three ripples happening inside it is it not yes yes that is why okay yes sir Okay so is it clear till there is your hand is still raised anything pending there okay so this was where we were actually using the carry to re-evaluate the circuit and arrive at an output if we are ready to give area then another idea could be assume that carry could be zero and assume that carry n could be 1. and calculate and calculate C out for both the cases depending on the value of c c out of K minus 1 stage that is the first the C in of this four bit circuit you can choose whether this one has to be used or this one has to be used in this case carry calculation is actually happening completely in parallel and you're just having a multiplexer at the output stage are you able to see this so in in other parts we were simply doing uh one circuit which was doing generate propagate that kind of function um over here uh we said okay all that generate propagate you do it for both CN is equal to 0 and C N equal to 1. depending on what was the value of c n I will choose the output directly at the multiplexer stage so now you even if you go to 128 bits all will run parallel and all that I need to do is the previous stage output goes as seen over here or goes as multiplexer input over here so the delay is reduced further um look at this example what we say bit 0 to 3 I calculate the output with zero carry I have calculated the output with one carry and then I use the carry in as the select signal for the multiplexer and I will get the sum generated and I will get the CO3 also hmm and the worst case critical path is as marked over here are you able to see this any questions no questions so successfully you are breaking the adder two times uh for each stage and then you are letting the other other stages evaluate according to the carry equal to 0 and 1 and then you are selecting based upon what is the carriage that you get from the previous one yes so doesn't this architecture result in exponential rise in the area consumption yeah yeah definitely instead of just one Carriage uh one one evaluation circuit you're putting two evaluation circuits one for carrying equal to zero one for carrying equal to one but the delay is also reducing okay I know so if we look at it uh if we look at it a slightly more advanced versions of this so over here notice we're talking about as 0 to 3 S 4 to 7 as 8 to 11 s 12 to 12 12 to 15. in a more advanced version uh or you know when we have it as this then this is what my total added delay is that uh plus n by m into T carry plus M into T marks plus T sum so this is this is what you would get as the overall delay of the system however another interesting way is you say that okay over here there are only two bits over here there are three bits or over here there are four bits and so on so I'm gradually increasing the total number of bits that my this system is taking up why am I doing that is a bit where is the concept of logical effort at the end stages near the output we increase the size so that we get the optimal deal not exactly so the output is the s0 and 1 are also outputs output but as 0 and 1 are also outputs foreign yeah see what is happening is you know that uh let us go to the previous slide you know that uh to arrive at this stage I will go through not only this but also this horizontal delay are you able to see this so by the time this c0 and C11 comes as the output 11 comes I would already already be waiting at the input of the multiplexer so I say why wait instead of calculating a ripple across four bits only I actually have more time now so I can calculate triple across 5 bits or 6 bits huh and when you do that uh what you achieve is that even though you are Rippling across five or six bits here because they are most most significant bits or close to the most significant bits the select signal anyway would take long time to come here hmm so so it's like time borrowing from it's like uh borrowing the time basically yeah you're using the extra time that is available to you because these extra multiplexer are also in the path and adding one more stage there let us say not stage one more bit in one in a in this kind of uh setting and this is how the delays change see this is Ripple carry this is linear select and this is the last square root select that we just did so you will not see much difference at the lower number of bits but today as we are talking about 64-bit processors and then probably 128 bit in a little while then you will see that this this part at and more number of bits uh square root select or linear add linear select adders are much faster so you can you can choose which one to use okay is it clear till here had a very small doubt I think uh like the two slides before can we go our previous close slides uh sir in this why don't uh we uh make the zero carry and one carry Adder parallel to each other and then give those inputs to mugs or if that's in parallel notice okay setup is going here and setup is going here also in parallel is represented like this they are going in parallel only okay okay thank you yeah so after the carry select address uh you must have heard about what is called last carry lookahead address also hmm so what do Carolina candidates do they do something similar to this select thing and uh they say that uh as you go into the higher bit there will be more time and therefore you could have a longer path set in there so what is the idea behind it you say that okay to be able to anticipate the output over here I don't need to wait for ripples or even inputs to come from this side let me at every gate itself let me at every gate it says uh use you know be uh the the earlier Gates iteratively so look at it over here we are saying C out three bar is dependent on generate 0 to 3 and propagate 0 to 3. now you do not need to see what propagate one was and whether the uh carry would go from propagate 1 to propagate 2 and all that you don't need to see all that it is already inbuilt into your one complex gate and you could have C output there right away okay so that is what look ahead topology looks like uh you see what we do then we what we see is that c0 is g0 and p 0 c i zero but c c o one is equal to G1 plus P 1 G 0 plus P1 P2 or P 1 p 0 C 0. CO2 is equal to G2 plus P2 G1 so basically you are kind of continuously adding recursively adding the delays there and uh what you see you can con continue to build a tree kind of hierarchically hmm so what does this mean this means that we're talking about uh how do we put it we're talking about these other trees where uh A's and B's and their components outputs are used for example a0 b0 will only influence S 0 and S1 because the carry would go there but in terms of higher widths we know that uh A1 B1 can also influence S3 so we built this kind of a tree and there are complex trees also see there are two stages in this the first state second stage third stage multiple States in these where we say that uh you know my S8 uh S7 goes to S8 and my S7 also goes to S9 and S10 and so on I built those trees and ensure that my overall functionality is correct huh and uh it is because of these lots of routing connections all these are routing connections is it not that in the adders we if you know if you remember there was Adder stage one then wires then Adder stage 2 than wires and then final adder remember that curve the the thing that we had shown in fact there was a question that someone asked in the chat window also why is there a separate region for wires there's a separate reason for wires because these they are all these interconnects that have to happen after every stage and they would rather have have them done neatly by allocating a safe region for them rather than going to higher metal level layers and using the resources there is that okay so again I am not going to ask you about make the brand country or make the this added tree or that allergy they intent to take you from this stage of Ripple carry to carry look ahead to carry select and so on is so that you know that there are different ways of arriving at the same output and depending on your project requirements you will have to choose the most appropriate one hmm so rajneesh sir so from where the GNP is coming from in the two slides before okay you tell me sir uh we could always generate gnb through those and Gates you remember the equations that we were looking at earlier for gng yes we simply generate those may be some same diagnosis yeah yeah so that is where that truth table May generate kill or propagate information was also important,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiDXtgAKLU0,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiDXtgAKLU0
Transcript: yes Okay so this is one photograph of a of a data path hardened data path and you will notice that it is not really symmetrical for all bits as it was saying it is not really symmetrical for all bits but yeah it's fine so we come into adders now what is an adder or are you able to see this functionality this truth table can you validate this is a correct truth table for the adder so what's this carrying status in which delete and propagate and generate are like that's a different thing are you able to validate the otherwise came up yes sir yes yes sir so now let us look at the last column what is Carry status so let us say that uh there was the inputs A and B were both zero hmm then independent of CI what will happen to co will be 0. are you able to see this yes sir now if either of A or B was one if either of them was one do you realize that whatever be the carry in it will be propagated further hello yes sir yes and when both A and B are 1 then again whatever we the CN C how it is definitely one are able to see this also yes sir so this is what we want to say or this is what this delete delete means whatever with the CN C out will be 0. propagate means whatever with the CN that will be propagated on C out generate means whatever be the same C out will be 1. are you able to see this yes so that is what Carry status means this this becomes important as we will look at uh uh implementation a typical or a very basic implementation of the slider would appear to be something like this that s is equal to 1 so we what we do we look at this this K map and we start to say okay it is or there is a one over here no no sorry we say okay my S is one over here then it is 1 over here and one over here and my C out is one over here and here so you you start to merge and you start to see if you could have K Maps uh being used to arrive at a logic and when you do that you arrive at this kind of a k map that s is one then either of these four Constructors one and see how it is one then either of these constructs is equal to 1. this is how you you must have done adders earlier also this is a simple adder full adder huh so we say that okay in the same order we we have used a b and c and then we have used inverts of B and inverse of c and inverse of a to make our logic of s so probably I will need a lot of gates to do it can I do it simpler so we say okay there was this information of delete propagate and generate at least that much I can use for generating carry out so we say that okay we express sum and carry as a function of propagate generate and delete only where carry out can be can be uh represented are represented as a sum of G Plus PCI be propagate a propagate is one then whatever is the CI comes on there or carry generated either carry generated or carries propagated and therefore CI becomes C out and S is that my propagate should be one it's a czar of propagate and CI in fact uh just to make our logic a little simpler use lesser number of devices many times you will use propagate as a or b because in A or B situation also whatever is the CN whenever CN has one you will propagate that are you able to see this see for C out I already have G there that is if a and b both are 1 I will have G equal to 1. so if c i was 0 in that case also I could say that let me use propagate as one because C out will be given as 1 from here generate generate part itself so many times just to make a logic simpler we may want to use propagate as a or b instead of a is or B so what is a plus b we could have said this from the truth table also from the truth table it is not really a plus b look at it uh if it was a plus b then uh in one one would also result in the yes this would have resulted in propagate but this has resulted in generate henna um that is not the case so in in actual terms it is generate but even if you call it propagate it doesn't matter because the co has to be generated the CI has CI will be one there I know because of generate you have used the variable as a or b a a and b so A and B are one so C of C naught can happen already are you able to see this yes so can you please like I got confused in this part why we are using uh two expressions for a propagate so you use only one expression A or B okay so but why why we are using two here I understood your point that I can use one and I'll get the functionality done but why two why to do it why two values of propagate two by expression for propagates see the exact expression is a is or B but we said that even if we use the expression of a or b yes sir C naught and S will not be different given this expression G is equal to C is caught is equal to g plus PCI and S is equal to P is our c i so these two outputs will still remain same even if I use propagate as a or b but or gate is much simpler than as or gate yeah yes that is why okay okay thank you take care yes so here it is written uh can also be expressed by a sum and Carry Out can also be expressed in terms of D and P yeah but I think instead of using D if we use G it would be more I think I think when you will Implement by using D two more inverter should be required right uh you see but you will need inverse of a and b s but uh just work it out it is not saying this is the minimum the the one with D and P will be the minimum gate implementation it says if you have dnp available with you even then you can Implement test and see now what it essentially intends to communicate is you need to do either of generate you need to do either generate or kill don't need to do both yes yes so even though we want we want to express some and carry as functions of PG and d p and either G or D will work for us yes okay that's the intent over here so now that was one bit adder if we have to make a four bit Adder what do we do we simply just say Okay this C out of bit 0 is C enough bit one and see out of one is C in of bit 2 and so on so what happens uh once the C out of 0 is generated it goes as seen of the second act full adder then third full adder then fourth full adder and then you get the output so what is happening I am Rippling the carry from one full adder to another and what is the uh worst case delay if as I increase the number of bits the number of hops increases linearly and therefore this is order n and what we also understand is that carry in to carry out paths should be as fast as possible are you able to see this these two aspects um yes sir so now if we go ahead and you know try to implement that full adder which this functionality in terms of a CMOS logic you would get a 28 transistor implementation something like this so you can you can do it at your on leisurely time where you will see that this is G A and B and then this is uh C and A or B hmm so this is your C out and similarly you will get your sum also based on by implementing whatever logic we had given there is this clear yes sir uh so in the last slide I have a question yes so here T Adder equal to n minus 1 T carry plus T some third just T some student it will be maximum of 3 sum and T Theory uh exactly the right to have the same understanding so let us look at this path uh what happens you realize that a b and everything was stable already these parts are stable already is it not when your carry came what what require what was required to be done when your carry came you only need to evaluate these parts of the gate Hannah so uh and you notice that CI has been kept as close to the output as possible so that the delay from C to out is minimum that is the delay mentioned as C sum or t sum whereas from a to sum or B to sum the delay could be slightly higher okay so already we have decreased the delays internally from from carry 2. from carry 2 yes so uh there is a different delay for generating a carry that is evident because delay to generator carry is this path delay to generate a sum is this path you know so this sum depends upon the voltage at node X which is also one of the inputs so it constitutes this entire path for next two years so yeah that can cause more delay for us than CO2 yeah done okay so what is also now important to see is that if you have a adder then you could actually have a invert Adder also there so what has happened over here you have a full adder over here you have inverted all the inputs and you say okay your output should also be inverted so S Bar of avci is equal to sum of a bar B Bar C A by CI bar and so on by using this inversion property what do you do you say okay I will not I will at least not use this inverter this one we may have to use but at least Joe C naught you see how generate currently inverter I can avoid using that and I would have see out going directly to the inverted full adder the next one I will have a regular full adder and then and again an inverted full adder so if you do it like this then what happens the total number of transistors in your system reduces because you don't need to put those additional inverters at the end of it so there are two things that are evident that there is a focus on reducing delay and then there is a focus on reducing area also because this is a large number of devices 28 transistors so we want the delay to be less but we want this number of devices also to be less so that is where figures in this mirror adder where you will see that the nmos and the pmos parts are kind of mirrors of each other and again uh the the circuit works fine where you say that okay you give CI from here and you get Co Sea House Bar and you get S Bar as outputs there Tigger so you can at at your own Leisure evaluate that this is this works fine this is fine for uh the functionality that you want to achieve for both C naught and S so but this uh this particular topology will be uh valid only if you have even number of stages right sir if you have odd number of stages then once again we need to add inverter at the subject and that we can just add on the last inverter last stage yes so this one inverter will come not it will not come 25 times yes sir so that we can always dominate appropriately so what are we talking about so for the mirror error for example we are saying that what you've done is the nmos and pmo stacks are completely symmetrical they are very similar to each other and uh I think from the discussion that we have had till now you must have already realized that the load on C out or the capacitances linked to generation of C out should be kept as low as possible why is that why should the capacitance is linked to generation of cob kept as low as possible because the carry has to propagate through the stages of Adder yes because the carry out of your state will go to the next stage then again the entire carry out will be new carry out will be generated for the next stage and so on at least if the propagation is going to happen so that is what we are looking at that we have to reduce the capacitances also we have to reduce the delays as you reduce the capacitances power and delay will automatically reduce hmm is that clear okay then see we looked at that what we looked at just now was a ripple Adder where data would you know move from a carry outward move from here to here to here finally giving a carry out three it's a very long path see the sum path is very short is very long especially if you have large number of bits so you will see that in the next few slides they're all we're just talking about how to anticipate the carry so one way is bypass the evaluations of uh C out for all these stages simply see if the overall P0 P1 P2 P3 are all one if they're all one then what you say is that okay since all the propagates are one then whatever was there on CI will definitely come on C out also are you with me any questions so we are saying is all the propagate servers so the uh the input carry will be reflected at the output directly yeah that we have studied okay yes hello so uh if we do it like that then what happens we have carry bypass for uh first four bits then we have carry bypass for the next four bits then we have carry bypass for the next four bits and so on so if there are total number of embeds then what is the total delay of the adder you will see the total delay of the adder would reduce would reduce such that uh you will have uh n divided by m minus 1. so the total number of delays that you will now need to see is what is the critical path the critical path would be something like this Hannah so would the largest delay also decrease just the largest delay yes it would decrease because uh earlier like uh it would decrease if you're using the propagate and kill valid topology because if you're not using propagate and kelvala thing then what happens is that all a b and c n will be calculated from Top dot top bottom and then we will arrive somewhere at sum and Carry Out however because you are using propagate and generate thing you already know what the C out could be uh much faster you don't need to evaluate after this comes you know what is the status of PNG the multiplexer inputs are already set and you either propagate or regenerate so it says time we'll see how it saves time further also but this saves time because now your Ripple is only for M number of bits so you'll see initially it appears that when the total number of bits is very less a bypass Adder because of its uh more complex logic and a multiplexer in there and so on may take a little extra delay however when you're talking about large number of bits say 32 64 128 or so on then Ripple Larry is much much slower than bypass Adder right and it is a consequence of these equations only nothing else okay any questions sir in the previous slides someone slider yeah can you explain this n by m minus one t by bus term once again okay so let us say this is 16 bit Adder Hannah this is 16-bit order how many bypass would it take would it pass through so first before that how many bits how many bits in one stage four hello yes sir so if you have a data Adder coming or set of inputs coming from here this this is the while this is being evaluated this part of data would have already been ready yes sir similarly here things would already be ready yes so when you are uh when you want to find the total delay what are you looking at setup delay plus carry generation delay Plus number of these that will be there n by m minus 1 so actually n by M minus 1 over here you can see so we know that okay 16 bits have been brought into have been split into four bits each so we would have of 4 minus one n by n by m 2 8 may be a parallel T by passes the delay of let us say this multiplexer yes yes because yes yes uh sir in case in all the bit 0 to 3 4 7 8 to 11 and 12 to 15. if this condition is not satisfied that p 0 P 1 p 2 p 3 is equal to one then in that case none of the carry would be directly going uh without without facing the carry propocational so if the propagations are not all all ones if the propagates are not all ones then what happens when you anyway do not be you will not be Rippling the carry to the entire path so your overall delay will actually be lesser only whatever was evaluated here earlier would already be valid we are talking about the worst case delay where you say okay the Ripple has to happen through the entire system hmm because if there is some p p and g equal to 0 at some bit whichever bit it is then it means that the evaluation that was done for higher bits than this were already clean because c c n was anyway 0 and it will remain zero it will not change it oh yes so as you increase the total number of bits you see that bypass Adder has much better performance than Ripple Adder but it has much more circuit also in there to be able to do all these through the automatic like so there is a setup circuit and so on which would be there ranjith you have a question oh yes sir in the previous slide okay sir I understood how we get the teacher M times the T carry uh plus uh n by m minus 1 times the T bypass but why once again we have M minus 1 times the T carries this this one I didn't understand Okay so all right let me show the variables are different this is this variable is MP carry and this variable is M minus 1 and 2 T Curry okay but y m minus 1 into 3 T carries but I didn't understand because always if we consider one single bypass stage the carry generation will happen parallely for all of them so and then we'll like uh bypass this for the first for the first stage that carry generation you have to still count now eight bar two you will have to count okay then you add the delays of uh various ones and for this one and it says there are if there are M bits then that would mean M minus 1 times Ripple could happen at least in this one is it not even for a four bit thing even for a 4-bit thing if the carry has to be generated like this every three ripples happening inside it is it not yes yes that is why okay yes sir Okay so is it clear till there is your hand is still raised anything pending there okay so this was where we were actually using the carry to re-evaluate the circuit and arrive at an output if we are ready to give area then another idea could be assume that carry could be zero and assume that carry n could be 1. and calculate and calculate C out for both the cases depending on the value of c c out of K minus 1 stage that is the first the C in of this four bit circuit you can choose whether this one has to be used or this one has to be used in this case carry calculation is actually happening completely in parallel and you're just having a multiplexer at the output stage are you able to see this so in in other parts we were simply doing uh one circuit which was doing generate propagate that kind of function um over here uh we said okay all that generate propagate you do it for both CN is equal to 0 and C N equal to 1. depending on what was the value of c n I will choose the output directly at the multiplexer stage so now you even if you go to 128 bits all will run parallel and all that I need to do is the previous stage output goes as seen over here or goes as multiplexer input over here so the delay is reduced further um look at this example what we say bit 0 to 3 I calculate the output with zero carry I have calculated the output with one carry and then I use the carry in as the select signal for the multiplexer and I will get the sum generated and I will get the CO3 also hmm and the worst case critical path is as marked over here are you able to see this any questions no questions so successfully you are breaking the adder two times uh for each stage and then you are letting the other other stages evaluate according to the carry equal to 0 and 1 and then you are selecting based upon what is the carriage that you get from the previous one yes so doesn't this architecture result in exponential rise in the area consumption yeah yeah definitely instead of just one Carriage uh one one evaluation circuit you're putting two evaluation circuits one for carrying equal to zero one for carrying equal to one but the delay is also reducing okay I know so if we look at it uh if we look at it a slightly more advanced versions of this so over here notice we're talking about as 0 to 3 S 4 to 7 as 8 to 11 s 12 to 12 12 to 15. in a more advanced version uh or you know when we have it as this then this is what my total added delay is that uh plus n by m into T carry plus M into T marks plus T sum so this is this is what you would get as the overall delay of the system however another interesting way is you say that okay over here there are only two bits over here there are three bits or over here there are four bits and so on so I'm gradually increasing the total number of bits that my this system is taking up why am I doing that is a bit where is the concept of logical effort at the end stages near the output we increase the size so that we get the optimal deal not exactly so the output is the s0 and 1 are also outputs output but as 0 and 1 are also outputs foreign yeah see what is happening is you know that uh let us go to the previous slide you know that uh to arrive at this stage I will go through not only this but also this horizontal delay are you able to see this so by the time this c0 and C11 comes as the output 11 comes I would already already be waiting at the input of the multiplexer so I say why wait instead of calculating a ripple across four bits only I actually have more time now so I can calculate triple across 5 bits or 6 bits huh and when you do that uh what you achieve is that even though you are Rippling across five or six bits here because they are most most significant bits or close to the most significant bits the select signal anyway would take long time to come here hmm so so it's like time borrowing from it's like uh borrowing the time basically yeah you're using the extra time that is available to you because these extra multiplexer are also in the path and adding one more stage there let us say not stage one more bit in one in a in this kind of uh setting and this is how the delays change see this is Ripple carry this is linear select and this is the last square root select that we just did so you will not see much difference at the lower number of bits but today as we are talking about 64-bit processors and then probably 128 bit in a little while then you will see that this this part at and more number of bits uh square root select or linear add linear select adders are much faster so you can you can choose which one to use okay is it clear till here had a very small doubt I think uh like the two slides before can we go our previous close slides uh sir in this why don't uh we uh make the zero carry and one carry Adder parallel to each other and then give those inputs to mugs or if that's in parallel notice okay setup is going here and setup is going here also in parallel is represented like this they are going in parallel only okay okay thank you yeah so after the carry select address uh you must have heard about what is called last carry lookahead address also hmm so what do Carolina candidates do they do something similar to this select thing and uh they say that uh as you go into the higher bit there will be more time and therefore you could have a longer path set in there so what is the idea behind it you say that okay to be able to anticipate the output over here I don't need to wait for ripples or even inputs to come from this side let me at every gate itself let me at every gate it says uh use you know be uh the the earlier Gates iteratively so look at it over here we are saying C out three bar is dependent on generate 0 to 3 and propagate 0 to 3. now you do not need to see what propagate one was and whether the uh carry would go from propagate 1 to propagate 2 and all that you don't need to see all that it is already inbuilt into your one complex gate and you could have C output there right away okay so that is what look ahead topology looks like uh you see what we do then we what we see is that c0 is g0 and p 0 c i zero but c c o one is equal to G1 plus P 1 G 0 plus P1 P2 or P 1 p 0 C 0. CO2 is equal to G2 plus P2 G1 so basically you are kind of continuously adding recursively adding the delays there and uh what you see you can con continue to build a tree kind of hierarchically hmm so what does this mean this means that we're talking about uh how do we put it we're talking about these other trees where uh A's and B's and their components outputs are used for example a0 b0 will only influence S 0 and S1 because the carry would go there but in terms of higher widths we know that uh A1 B1 can also influence S3 so we built this kind of a tree and there are complex trees also see there are two stages in this the first state second stage third stage multiple States in these where we say that uh you know my S8 uh S7 goes to S8 and my S7 also goes to S9 and S10 and so on I built those trees and ensure that my overall functionality is correct huh and uh it is because of these lots of routing connections all these are routing connections is it not that in the adders we if you know if you remember there was Adder stage one then wires then Adder stage 2 than wires and then final adder remember that curve the the thing that we had shown in fact there was a question that someone asked in the chat window also why is there a separate region for wires there's a separate reason for wires because these they are all these interconnects that have to happen after every stage and they would rather have have them done neatly by allocating a safe region for them rather than going to higher metal level layers and using the resources there is that okay so again I am not going to ask you about make the brand country or make the this added tree or that allergy they intent to take you from this stage of Ripple carry to carry look ahead to carry select and so on is so that you know that there are different ways of arriving at the same output and depending on your project requirements you will have to choose the most appropriate one hmm so rajneesh sir so from where the GNP is coming from in the two slides before okay you tell me sir uh we could always generate gnb through those and Gates you remember the equations that we were looking at earlier for gng yes we simply generate those may be some same diagnosis yeah yeah so that is where that truth table May generate kill or propagate information was also important"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,V0mLroNJrjs,okay now we come to multipliers so what are multipliers you know we have done all of us have done multiplications there is a multiplicand and there is a multiplier and there are intermediate stages and there is a final result these intermediate stages are called as partial products so if you look at it in terms of an array of array multiplier then what are we saying is that isab there is a full adder over here that i need there is a half adder over here that i need and so on so i need a few full adders and a few half adders to make my circuit complete and robust so uh your out your inputs y0 and z0 would go uh and will be handed and everything will happen and you will have a way to arrive at outputs over here so these are all the outputs are you able to see this z0 is only dependent on y0 and x0 z1 however is also dependent on other topics are you able to see this this is kind of a direct movement from this thing to another then if we look at a big big uh multiplier then what are we saying that there could be multiple critical paths also there could be a critical path from here to final or from here to final which one would you choose to characterize your delay so for the critical delay i think the the path which is following all the full adders will be chosen yes that will be the most critical delay but they are all critical paths and depending on the inputs you may have something different somewhere see look at it like this full adder full adder half adder full adder full adder full adder full adder half adder full adder full adder or whatever okay so if there are more full ladders that is where you are more worried so what you do you just reorganize your partial products uh in such a way that you know where to put in the first stage for example you will only have these uh half adders and in the second stage you will have both full ladders and half adders and in the final stage you have only half adders are you able to see this so this is the famous wall history multiplier how to implement this as we just saw this is the region where wiring would happen z3 and the c out of fa will go somewhere it will influence results there and so on okay so i'm just quickly giving you a glimpse of different kinds of multiplier implementations also for even for a wallace tree for example there could be y 0 1 2 3 and then y 3 y 4 y 5 or i could say 0 y 1 2 and 5 3 4 3 4 5 and these two could happen in parallel are you able to see this hello so multipliers are not as intuitive as adders but uh are you getting the sense that there is a way to optimize multipliers also are you getting at least that sense yes yeah that is all that is required so that if you intend to pick up a project you at least have some words in your mind that okay there's a brent kung adder or there is a wall street multiplier or there is this kind of multiplier and i could have these kind of options amongst which to choose to design the most appropriate multiplier for my application and so on so i'm just giving you a top-level glimpse of a few adders and multipliers if you go out in academic literature you will see many many more of them and not even claiming that wall street multiplier is the best you could have a multiplier which is still better than wall street multiplier what i am saying is is that there are ways to optimize it and people have done it and you can also do it if you you know but for that you have to study existing all the existing ones and then you go a step or two further but you can also do it okay is it clear till here so what we are talking about is that in a multiplier also you have to important you know it's very important to identify the critical path and then you try to reduce the overall delay by let us say doing data encoding for example in booth multiplier or we just saw the wall street multiplier or very importantly pipelining see when we were doing sequential circuits you were asking but what is important to realize is that having all these adders in their full adders and half adders and all those things in there will mean that the delays will be high if you do not want to compute the entire uh you know multiplying chain all the partial products in one cycle you can split it into my into more than one cycle stage wise you can say that i can actually have this as a three-stage pipeline so what that what does what does a pipeline the architecture for a multiplier do what does pipelining do over here why do we want to pipeline esther you're saying something like we can have different stages so that you know for example we can have smaller clock cycles in architectural levels you can operate at a much higher frequency so even though the throughput of your wireless multiplier is small remaining part of the circuit is at least experiencing faster clock cycles and you have better results overall okay so with this multipliers we are getting a kind of a multiplier and those adders we're kind of getting a glimpse of system level optimizations that how are these circuits can also be used in your adders and other places but what is important is how to optimize a path a data path in a way at a system level so now at the very last part of our arithmetic circuits which is called shifters so what is happening you have two inputs or a i and a i a i minus one and uh you see a i is going ai minus 1 is going to this part also a i is coming to this part also and depending on select whether i want to do a right shift or a left shift or a no up i will use ai to go to bi or ai to go to bi minus 1 or ai minus 1 to go to bi are you able to see this yes and this shifter can actually also be implemented in a slightly different way where uh you are talking about multiple levels of shifts also that you could shift one bit two bits or three bits hmm this is the barrel shifter that so in the previous shifter what could you do you could go left you could go right and you could stay there no up in this particular shifter what you are saying is that this is a barrel and you are moving in this kind of a fashion okay why am i getting a feeling that a lot of overhead transmission is happening i'm not getting any feedback from you guys trends i know i'm not really explaining these circuits but are you getting the sense of it the top level feel the intuition are behind it are you getting that yes sir okay so when you want to design these users you go into much more details but i want you to introduce to be introduced to these circuits okay that's the only intent of this lecture today memories also memories where we will talk about at least memory cell in a little detail but again there the intent again would be to just introduce you to those topics so this is how a barrel shifter you know the schematic that we made here these n mosses and everything this is how their layout would appear to be you see over here the entire routing is happening through poly so this pink one is poly would you be able to use this in advanced technologies is not allowed poly bending is not allowed and poly resistance is huge because poly is so thin so many reasons why you would not want to do it but this was one of the optimal designs and older technology say 180 nanometer okay so this is a four cross four barrel shifter where you can shift four bits and you can jump number of bits that you want to shift okay that kind of brings us to a close of arithmetic circuits the lecture on arithmetic circuits and we will switch over to any questions that you may have about the project or anything yes you said i have a question related to this multiplier basically we are looking at a very fine detail of how we can improve the circuits and then make faster circuits as well as a smaller circuit also but but at the level of synthesis if we say that in a liberty file i have a different types of adders uh available there so they have different areas also and uh bigger ones are faster yeah so at the level of synthesis when i go to like let's say innovas then in that in that also would i find these kind of topologies uh implemented the smaller one would be ripple carry and larger one would be the carry could be it depends on how the library team has designed stuff so these are hard ips that the library team would have generated so yes you could find them but you may not depending on whether they are whether they were designed by the library team there or not but if you are a part of the library team who has to design these adders and multipliers then you need to know all this stuff how to optimize a circuit at a system level you may simply say okay i will want to use the adders amongst these adders this one meets my requirements best and therefore i will use this one so this this knowledge of the circuits of address multiplier is still more useful at level of circuit design so this knowledge yes how to like propagate generate and everything all that is valid for circuit design part only but yes even even at a system design level when you know that okay carry look ahead is faster than ripple carry you can always prefer it in your synthesis run and your overall design we can enforce that yeah you can enforce that yes that's it so the diagram of that complex diagram of blue card topology that was given ah except that cannot be implemented in a standard cell design right because somewhere uh it was ptl based logic plus cmos also used so that data path will be designed separately is this a standard cell no is this a standard template that we're talking about no anna so these circuits are now not standard cells they are hardened macros okay eyepiece that can directly be used yes sir one more question sir all these are combinational logics only uh and at the input and at the output there will be flip flops so uh from a standard cell design we are providing this uh inputs to some ip and then again we are obtaining output in a standard cell design only yes and then how in layout a discontinuity of standard cell is means there is a there to be discontinued in standard cell designed so it will we will not have standard cells abutting these cells now these macros will be there they will not be abutting the standard cells there would be some space between the likelihood and the sand itself and you will connect through wires yes so they would also be spaced far apart from that standard cell implementation no far apart how much far is far apart i do not know but yes they will not be abutting the standard cells that much i know yes sir sir also one more thing sorry in case of multiplier especially there would be huge difference in contamination deal and propagation yes so very significant difference while designing flip flops how the setup and hold are met in these cases this means there would be let's say 10 times difference could also be there right so how does designing flip flop in this figure in for the for designing a flip flop you want to keep the hole as slow as possible and you want to keep the setup as low as possible both you want to keep low so independent of whether you are a multiplier whether the flip flop is at the end of a multiplier or wherever that doesn't matter flip flop design is independent of where that flip flop is used is it not yes sir now if your circuit has such vast delays then you could say that okay i will probably add one buffer in there so that i do not violate the whole time even when the contamination delay is there so then also you were talking about breaking into stages in case of multi multiplier so each stages in between a flip flop would come something like that um you pipelined it yes pipeline means that after every stage the thing is registered somewhere the partial product will be registered yes okay so anything else i think we are any way up the class time so if there's anything else we can look into it otherwise we'll close the class sir i have a i have a query regarding the project uh sorry my my project is oai implementation of the complex non-complex style uh so i have implemented the layout for the complex time i just want to get it reviewed from here and whether the area usage is good or not so can i go ahead and present the screen sir we can do that but did you already see the office has the feedback that i gave in the offices yes sir i saw the feedback that shakti and his team received yeah i was just concerned if uh i have the same kind have you incorporated the feedback in your design or not or you want the same feedback to be given to you no sir i i try to use the area efficiently but the problem is that in the dominar logic style we will have we have used the beekeeper so i will have to route the output of the inverter to the input of the beekeeper so and uh so this uh this has uh for the routing we need uh the space for that metal to be routed yeah so over there just a small area is not being occupied by any of the transporters you can show the layout piece yes yeah oh sir can you please make me the co-host wait i will allow multiple participants to share simultaneously yes anyway i'm not sharing anything so you should be allowed to share oh no sir it says the host has disabled oh is that the case yes sir um no who can share i have already said you should be able to share yes no i can share you are always able to share so sir uh this is the layout that i have made sir so here i have the v keeper and then this is the pmos and then here comes the logic for a b c d e and f the six inputs and then i have the two uh inverters so this is uh to send the uh to restore the logic levels uh so i'm sending the output to the input of the v keeper and then here is the output so uh ranjit my my only uh thought that i have when i look at it is that the first inverter that you have put for it is you know the on the right side the first one yeah this one net 35 net 44 inverters so net 35 is going on the gate net 44 is going on the output why could you not put net 44 on the left side if you would put net 44 on the left side then you would be able to share the vdd of this inverter with the vdd of the next inverter oh sir i didn't understand so look at this inverter first inverter there is vdd on the left side source drain sir and net 44 on the right side yes sir if you would instead put net 44 on the left side okay and vdd on the right side okay then you would be able to share the vdd across the two inverters okay okay understood sir so your weight would reduce yes yes yes understood that is what you have to always observe is there any additional sharing that i can think of okay yes i'm very happy to see that the two p moses you have put one over one you know one beneath the other and it is possible for you this is very nice the same area yes sir but you still lost some area in this not being able to share vdd on ground of two adjacent inverters yes this should always be done okay sir and this would probably also do one more thing as soon as you put net 44 on the left side you will realize that you will not need to now vertically bring down net 44. uh yes sir this i can i can easily doubt it uh yeah so width would reduce but would reduce still further yes sir in fact even for net 35 yes you can you have presently taken it from above the first set of n masses and then brought it down uh yes sir there is a vertical net 35 stacks yes sir metal i know see that can you possibly in this in this second stage of uh stuff use you know you can just push the active of uh of these two inverters a net 29 net 35 uh inverter a little up on left 29 at 29 and net 35 you then what happens is beneath this active you will have more space and you can probably route net 35 from in that space itself you will not need to go up ah sir but i can't route it below because uh the drain of this is uh c and d is connected to source of a and b so i cannot enter then do one thing then do one thing put net 29 in the center of this gate sorry sir net 29 where exactly net 35 is in the center uh yes sir yes yes put net 29 in the center okay okay then net 35 will already come on the drain side you will not need the vertical wire there okay yes sir so that way you will be able to reduce your width very very significantly oh yes sir ticket yes sir so let's do it like that okay sir yes thank you sir okay all the best guys then uh and uh i will see you now on monday in the office to see okay what is the critical path how much margin do i have and then these this was decided okay so technology all that you need to see is how much slack is there in your critical path and can you add one more bit there okay so it's not decided randomly like two bits no no no no no decided on the basis of uh the length of the path there yeah are the most optimal parts okay yes thank you thank you all the best guys see you sir yes so do we have like two minutes time i wanted to ask something related to wikipedia uh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0mLroNJrjs,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0mLroNJrjs
Transcript: okay now we come to multipliers so what are multipliers you know we have done all of us have done multiplications there is a multiplicand and there is a multiplier and there are intermediate stages and there is a final result these intermediate stages are called as partial products so if you look at it in terms of an array of array multiplier then what are we saying is that isab there is a full adder over here that i need there is a half adder over here that i need and so on so i need a few full adders and a few half adders to make my circuit complete and robust so uh your out your inputs y0 and z0 would go uh and will be handed and everything will happen and you will have a way to arrive at outputs over here so these are all the outputs are you able to see this z0 is only dependent on y0 and x0 z1 however is also dependent on other topics are you able to see this this is kind of a direct movement from this thing to another then if we look at a big big uh multiplier then what are we saying that there could be multiple critical paths also there could be a critical path from here to final or from here to final which one would you choose to characterize your delay so for the critical delay i think the the path which is following all the full adders will be chosen yes that will be the most critical delay but they are all critical paths and depending on the inputs you may have something different somewhere see look at it like this full adder full adder half adder full adder full adder full adder full adder half adder full adder full adder or whatever okay so if there are more full ladders that is where you are more worried so what you do you just reorganize your partial products uh in such a way that you know where to put in the first stage for example you will only have these uh half adders and in the second stage you will have both full ladders and half adders and in the final stage you have only half adders are you able to see this so this is the famous wall history multiplier how to implement this as we just saw this is the region where wiring would happen z3 and the c out of fa will go somewhere it will influence results there and so on okay so i'm just quickly giving you a glimpse of different kinds of multiplier implementations also for even for a wallace tree for example there could be y 0 1 2 3 and then y 3 y 4 y 5 or i could say 0 y 1 2 and 5 3 4 3 4 5 and these two could happen in parallel are you able to see this hello so multipliers are not as intuitive as adders but uh are you getting the sense that there is a way to optimize multipliers also are you getting at least that sense yes yeah that is all that is required so that if you intend to pick up a project you at least have some words in your mind that okay there's a brent kung adder or there is a wall street multiplier or there is this kind of multiplier and i could have these kind of options amongst which to choose to design the most appropriate multiplier for my application and so on so i'm just giving you a top-level glimpse of a few adders and multipliers if you go out in academic literature you will see many many more of them and not even claiming that wall street multiplier is the best you could have a multiplier which is still better than wall street multiplier what i am saying is is that there are ways to optimize it and people have done it and you can also do it if you you know but for that you have to study existing all the existing ones and then you go a step or two further but you can also do it okay is it clear till here so what we are talking about is that in a multiplier also you have to important you know it's very important to identify the critical path and then you try to reduce the overall delay by let us say doing data encoding for example in booth multiplier or we just saw the wall street multiplier or very importantly pipelining see when we were doing sequential circuits you were asking but what is important to realize is that having all these adders in their full adders and half adders and all those things in there will mean that the delays will be high if you do not want to compute the entire uh you know multiplying chain all the partial products in one cycle you can split it into my into more than one cycle stage wise you can say that i can actually have this as a three-stage pipeline so what that what does what does a pipeline the architecture for a multiplier do what does pipelining do over here why do we want to pipeline esther you're saying something like we can have different stages so that you know for example we can have smaller clock cycles in architectural levels you can operate at a much higher frequency so even though the throughput of your wireless multiplier is small remaining part of the circuit is at least experiencing faster clock cycles and you have better results overall okay so with this multipliers we are getting a kind of a multiplier and those adders we're kind of getting a glimpse of system level optimizations that how are these circuits can also be used in your adders and other places but what is important is how to optimize a path a data path in a way at a system level so now at the very last part of our arithmetic circuits which is called shifters so what is happening you have two inputs or a i and a i a i minus one and uh you see a i is going ai minus 1 is going to this part also a i is coming to this part also and depending on select whether i want to do a right shift or a left shift or a no up i will use ai to go to bi or ai to go to bi minus 1 or ai minus 1 to go to bi are you able to see this yes and this shifter can actually also be implemented in a slightly different way where uh you are talking about multiple levels of shifts also that you could shift one bit two bits or three bits hmm this is the barrel shifter that so in the previous shifter what could you do you could go left you could go right and you could stay there no up in this particular shifter what you are saying is that this is a barrel and you are moving in this kind of a fashion okay why am i getting a feeling that a lot of overhead transmission is happening i'm not getting any feedback from you guys trends i know i'm not really explaining these circuits but are you getting the sense of it the top level feel the intuition are behind it are you getting that yes sir okay so when you want to design these users you go into much more details but i want you to introduce to be introduced to these circuits okay that's the only intent of this lecture today memories also memories where we will talk about at least memory cell in a little detail but again there the intent again would be to just introduce you to those topics so this is how a barrel shifter you know the schematic that we made here these n mosses and everything this is how their layout would appear to be you see over here the entire routing is happening through poly so this pink one is poly would you be able to use this in advanced technologies is not allowed poly bending is not allowed and poly resistance is huge because poly is so thin so many reasons why you would not want to do it but this was one of the optimal designs and older technology say 180 nanometer okay so this is a four cross four barrel shifter where you can shift four bits and you can jump number of bits that you want to shift okay that kind of brings us to a close of arithmetic circuits the lecture on arithmetic circuits and we will switch over to any questions that you may have about the project or anything yes you said i have a question related to this multiplier basically we are looking at a very fine detail of how we can improve the circuits and then make faster circuits as well as a smaller circuit also but but at the level of synthesis if we say that in a liberty file i have a different types of adders uh available there so they have different areas also and uh bigger ones are faster yeah so at the level of synthesis when i go to like let's say innovas then in that in that also would i find these kind of topologies uh implemented the smaller one would be ripple carry and larger one would be the carry could be it depends on how the library team has designed stuff so these are hard ips that the library team would have generated so yes you could find them but you may not depending on whether they are whether they were designed by the library team there or not but if you are a part of the library team who has to design these adders and multipliers then you need to know all this stuff how to optimize a circuit at a system level you may simply say okay i will want to use the adders amongst these adders this one meets my requirements best and therefore i will use this one so this this knowledge of the circuits of address multiplier is still more useful at level of circuit design so this knowledge yes how to like propagate generate and everything all that is valid for circuit design part only but yes even even at a system design level when you know that okay carry look ahead is faster than ripple carry you can always prefer it in your synthesis run and your overall design we can enforce that yeah you can enforce that yes that's it so the diagram of that complex diagram of blue card topology that was given ah except that cannot be implemented in a standard cell design right because somewhere uh it was ptl based logic plus cmos also used so that data path will be designed separately is this a standard cell no is this a standard template that we're talking about no anna so these circuits are now not standard cells they are hardened macros okay eyepiece that can directly be used yes sir one more question sir all these are combinational logics only uh and at the input and at the output there will be flip flops so uh from a standard cell design we are providing this uh inputs to some ip and then again we are obtaining output in a standard cell design only yes and then how in layout a discontinuity of standard cell is means there is a there to be discontinued in standard cell designed so it will we will not have standard cells abutting these cells now these macros will be there they will not be abutting the standard cells there would be some space between the likelihood and the sand itself and you will connect through wires yes so they would also be spaced far apart from that standard cell implementation no far apart how much far is far apart i do not know but yes they will not be abutting the standard cells that much i know yes sir sir also one more thing sorry in case of multiplier especially there would be huge difference in contamination deal and propagation yes so very significant difference while designing flip flops how the setup and hold are met in these cases this means there would be let's say 10 times difference could also be there right so how does designing flip flop in this figure in for the for designing a flip flop you want to keep the hole as slow as possible and you want to keep the setup as low as possible both you want to keep low so independent of whether you are a multiplier whether the flip flop is at the end of a multiplier or wherever that doesn't matter flip flop design is independent of where that flip flop is used is it not yes sir now if your circuit has such vast delays then you could say that okay i will probably add one buffer in there so that i do not violate the whole time even when the contamination delay is there so then also you were talking about breaking into stages in case of multi multiplier so each stages in between a flip flop would come something like that um you pipelined it yes pipeline means that after every stage the thing is registered somewhere the partial product will be registered yes okay so anything else i think we are any way up the class time so if there's anything else we can look into it otherwise we'll close the class sir i have a i have a query regarding the project uh sorry my my project is oai implementation of the complex non-complex style uh so i have implemented the layout for the complex time i just want to get it reviewed from here and whether the area usage is good or not so can i go ahead and present the screen sir we can do that but did you already see the office has the feedback that i gave in the offices yes sir i saw the feedback that shakti and his team received yeah i was just concerned if uh i have the same kind have you incorporated the feedback in your design or not or you want the same feedback to be given to you no sir i i try to use the area efficiently but the problem is that in the dominar logic style we will have we have used the beekeeper so i will have to route the output of the inverter to the input of the beekeeper so and uh so this uh this has uh for the routing we need uh the space for that metal to be routed yeah so over there just a small area is not being occupied by any of the transporters you can show the layout piece yes yeah oh sir can you please make me the co-host wait i will allow multiple participants to share simultaneously yes anyway i'm not sharing anything so you should be allowed to share oh no sir it says the host has disabled oh is that the case yes sir um no who can share i have already said you should be able to share yes no i can share you are always able to share so sir uh this is the layout that i have made sir so here i have the v keeper and then this is the pmos and then here comes the logic for a b c d e and f the six inputs and then i have the two uh inverters so this is uh to send the uh to restore the logic levels uh so i'm sending the output to the input of the v keeper and then here is the output so uh ranjit my my only uh thought that i have when i look at it is that the first inverter that you have put for it is you know the on the right side the first one yeah this one net 35 net 44 inverters so net 35 is going on the gate net 44 is going on the output why could you not put net 44 on the left side if you would put net 44 on the left side then you would be able to share the vdd of this inverter with the vdd of the next inverter oh sir i didn't understand so look at this inverter first inverter there is vdd on the left side source drain sir and net 44 on the right side yes sir if you would instead put net 44 on the left side okay and vdd on the right side okay then you would be able to share the vdd across the two inverters okay okay understood sir so your weight would reduce yes yes yes understood that is what you have to always observe is there any additional sharing that i can think of okay yes i'm very happy to see that the two p moses you have put one over one you know one beneath the other and it is possible for you this is very nice the same area yes sir but you still lost some area in this not being able to share vdd on ground of two adjacent inverters yes this should always be done okay sir and this would probably also do one more thing as soon as you put net 44 on the left side you will realize that you will not need to now vertically bring down net 44. uh yes sir this i can i can easily doubt it uh yeah so width would reduce but would reduce still further yes sir in fact even for net 35 yes you can you have presently taken it from above the first set of n masses and then brought it down uh yes sir there is a vertical net 35 stacks yes sir metal i know see that can you possibly in this in this second stage of uh stuff use you know you can just push the active of uh of these two inverters a net 29 net 35 uh inverter a little up on left 29 at 29 and net 35 you then what happens is beneath this active you will have more space and you can probably route net 35 from in that space itself you will not need to go up ah sir but i can't route it below because uh the drain of this is uh c and d is connected to source of a and b so i cannot enter then do one thing then do one thing put net 29 in the center of this gate sorry sir net 29 where exactly net 35 is in the center uh yes sir yes yes put net 29 in the center okay okay then net 35 will already come on the drain side you will not need the vertical wire there okay yes sir so that way you will be able to reduce your width very very significantly oh yes sir ticket yes sir so let's do it like that okay sir yes thank you sir okay all the best guys then uh and uh i will see you now on monday in the office to see okay what is the critical path how much margin do i have and then these this was decided okay so technology all that you need to see is how much slack is there in your critical path and can you add one more bit there okay so it's not decided randomly like two bits no no no no no decided on the basis of uh the length of the path there yeah are the most optimal parts okay yes thank you thank you all the best guys see you sir yes so do we have like two minutes time i wanted to ask something related to wikipedia uh"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,Z-sJ1vuRj2E,about sense amplifier today okay so why memories like we talked about the entire library we talked about some arithmetic circuits then why memories why is what is so important about memories that we're talking about in dvd course also certain memories are the minimalistic storage elements which provides high density so if we consider a case of a resistor or a latch for a flip-flop then those involve large number of transistors even though they provide the storage functionality that they don't provide the high package density so we need to specifically look into the models thank you ranjit so you already made my task a little easier in the sense that what we are saying is that uh memories are high density storage elements and they are so important that today they cover uh you know in in advanced socs they cover up to 70 to 80 percent of chip area so come to think of it all that you've discussed in this course both libraries and everything that is not even 20 of total chip area do you see that and and since memories cover that huge area or have such a huge footprint on a chip we talk about memories in this course also and that is also the reason why we have a separate course all together on memories that will be running in the next semester so uh why is it that memories consume so much of area or why so much of area is given to memories see in a typical computer architecture you will see that memories are there at various levels there are register files which could be shift registers but which could also be small small memories there are caches of different level of hierarchy first level cache which is integrated inside the processor it operates at the same speed as the processor it has to operate uh that like it would possibly access every cycle and if you've done the course on computer architecture you also know that there is an instruction cache there is a data cache and there could be the concept of a unified cache also so there are these caches level one cache level two cache level three cache and all that so all this is on chip and then outside the chip also then you have main memory which which would typically be dram we will cover about dram also in the memory design course and beyond the dram there will be non-volt non-volatile storage the pendrives that you have where you would store your data so do you realize that memories are kind of pervasive as we move away from the processors they are also becoming slower so while resistor files operate at the data path speed are really really very very fast number one caches operate at processor speed the second level caches may actually take multiple processor cycles third level caching materials takes still longer and as you go to main memory which is off chip the time duration or the time of access increases multi multi-fold okay so it would take hundreds of cycles to access a dram from a chip so how you size these memories and how you organize this architecture is critical and you look quite a you you look into quite a bit of it i hope uh in detail in the computer architecture course how many of you have done the ca course and uh have you covered these different hierarchy architectures different hierarchies and memory architecture so raising hands to tell me that you have done the course and you understand this or you are raising hands to ask questions so please ask ranjit oh no sorry it was just to indicate okay akash that was also to indicate yes that's us okay just two of you have done cia course others have not done computer architecture i'm very surprised okay so the chat window says class runs okay i get it so many of you have done the cfos and you do understand that memory hierarchy is is critical to managers important to manage in mdt course we'll spend just about a lecture or two on on memory hierarchy and how to size this up because we have already covered it and see it but we will actually spend more time on how to design the level one cache or level two cache or you know the dram so that you get the you you achieve the desired objective whether it is high density or high speed or low power whatever it is so uh and just already mentioned that uh the standard you know the the latches and the flip flops they take much more area than a standard 60 memory cell so we will come to just that but before that when we talk about memories we also need to realize that whether it is resistor fires or l1 l2 caches or l3 caches there are different kinds of memories that come into picture one set of memory is random access which are static rams and drams but then on any chip you would also have stuff like free force have you heard about first in first out c4s which are used to implement queues you also have last and first outs which are used to implement stacks so when you have when you do programming you must have definitely uh you know in data structures courses you must know about stacks so there are memories which would be used to implement stacks then there are shift registers which you already know and then there are content addressable memories you know what is a cam have you ever heard about it earlier no sir yes sir okay huh okay who has said okay can you tell us about it what is it yes so it is a type of associated memory that is used for high speed searching applications it is means it basically finds the data and returns the address of matching data great so uh see typically when you talk of a memory you would typically give an address location and you would want to find out what is written on that particular address a cam is something different cam does not know what the address is cam knows what the content is so you search for the content and that leads you to the address and then from that address you may do further operations now where is it needed consider the case of a of a network router a network switch you know that you want to route some packet of data to google's us office so you want that you know that the destination is us but in a particular routing switch all that you can tell is that okay out of these four switches which one would take me closer to the us destination to the us server so you search for us in the content and whatever programmation or whatever programming has been done at the at the router level it will tell you oh go to port number 25 it will route your packet to port number 25. now you switch the router off you turn it on again next time around it may route you to port number 29 port number 2 wherever whatever has been configured so depending on data you will get a different address to go to to send your packet to that is what is content addressable memory this is also very widely or like content addressable memories are are tightly coupled to processors so that when when a particular instruction is given the follow-up instructions are brought in quickly based on the content the you know the locate by by doing a quick content search as to which location is this particular instruction stored and then i pull out remaining instructions from that region quickly so cams are specific memories and we will not really talk about them much in the course but just for the sake of completeness tams are also non-random access read write memories now while these are read write memories and these are all volatile now like volatile means that when you switch off the power the contents will get erased so when you power up the circuit again you will need to write the memory right inside the memory all over again but you don't want but or you also need memories which would not erase all the data is it not that is where we have nv read write memories that is non-volatile read write memories these include electric electrically programmable roms electrically erasable programmable roms and flash memories so what is the use of these flash and eeproms and eproms anyone so these memories uh firstly they provide the non-volatility and the second thing is that this can uh these are facilitate the large number of rights so they can be arrested and right written yeah so uh eproms over here cannot be raised but ee prompts can be raised so eproms are electrically programmable roms so what you do here is you kind of blow away the fuses once the fuse is blown now you cannot rebuild it again so eeproms where would they be used can you think of a use case boot sequence yes boot sequence or for example uh there is a standard set-top box chip which you also sell to airtel and you would sell to bharti and you said to tata sky and you sell to this tv and everyone now this tv wants to program such that people cannot use their set-top box or their dish tv their their box with let's say tata style so they will use the eprom there to program the the memory and prevent access from any other provider to this particular box eeproms would also allow erase they could be for example for boot code where we say that okay it may happen that i want to give a firmware update one year down the line so i should have the flexibility to erase also so eeproms would be used there and then flash flash all of you know where would you use flash where would you use flash there are memory cards and everything has flashed your cell phone has a flash everything all the solid-state storage that we talk about is with flash so then there are roms roms are read-only memories you cannot write into them where do you use a rom against data and all in those boot sequence and and and those parts where you are just stored which address location for example you would go to to get the first output or stuff like that so boot sequence would typically be stored in roms this you cannot change once it is programmed you cannot change it all the code memory will be of type now yes so this is this is the wide range of memories that exist so we will talk about as i mentioned srams will talk about b rams lifos c4 shift resistors and cams will not talk about as much uh but we will talk about eprom's eeproms flash and then roms when we would when we will do the mdt course there okay now when we talk about these different onset memories and off-chip memories so on-chip memories are typically srams whether we are talking of l1 cache l2 cache lc cache when it is onset it is typically srans they are very fast but they are not as dense we talk about six transistor estrangs you've heard about 60 sram cells 60 sram cells no one yes sir so it has two transistors to control the bit lines and the two back to back coupled in motors yeah so 60 transistor cells so we are talking about six transistors to save one bit of data when we talk about drams drams are one transistor and one capacitor and flash flash is actually effectively less than one transistor per bit of data on every transistor you could actually be storing two bits or even three bits of data and that is where it is much more dense endurance means the number of times you can read write into that particular memory so in a sram it is six transistors fully static cmos logic regular voltage operation endurance is maximum very high level of endurance uh d dams again very high level of endurance even though we have a capacitor uh which could leak a little but even then the endurance is very high but flash we actually when we will you know do the course we will see that we in flash we actually use very high voltages and therefore endurance goes bad we cannot really do as many number of reads and writes as you can do in a sram so there are various figures of merit you know speed density endurance power refresh so what does refresh mean what does refresh mean anyone restoring the data that was stored stored on this cell yes refresh means that if you do not restore the data on a on a regular basis then what happens if you do not restore the data on a regular basis you may actually end up losing data you may actually end up losing information so you have to refresh and drams because they store data on a capacitor it's a floating capacitor uh that can leak this this charge can leak therefore you need to refresh the dram the contents of a dr okay retention we already talked about as you switch off the power would go off and and the contents would be erased and then mechanism is by stable latch or a capacitor or in a flash with using a mechanism like fn tunneling or hot carrier injection to to be able to do read and write operation okay faizal you have a question so first thing is uh when we were talking about flash he was saying uh on one transistor we will store two to three bits so how is that possible like a transistor magic so we have a floating gate there we use like uh you know till now we've just looked at a gate oxide and then the substrate yes and flash we use special kind of devices where you have gate one you have silicon dioxide you have gate two you have silicon dioxide and then you have the substrate is it like the floating gate or something sorry fg was huh floating it was yeah so you have a floating gate there in which you can trap charges okay okay yes sir when you trap charges the vt would change and then you will be able to say that what is the kind of uh data stored there okay and so one more thing can you please reiterate why do we need to refresh because in these rams you're storing data on a capacitor it's like a dynamic gate so why did you need to use a keeper there because that data would leak some charge sharing can happen something can happen some mishap can happen due to which that data can be lost so you put a keeper in a dynamic gate is it not yes yes sir now for a dram if you start to put keepers in every cell then you will become a 2t1c cell area would double we don't want that yes sir therefore we say okay we will keep one t and one c but every now and then we will refresh the data we will restart we will put the charge on the capacitor again yes okay underfoot thank you sir yeah so that's a quick overview of different kinds of memories that we have but whatever be the kind of memory you will see that we can still cover them in one course because they are organized in a very standard way what you have is a structured array of storage elements which are accessed you know if let us say we are storing one word in this particular row then we have a decoder which would select a particular word and we have ios which would give out the output so by putting them in a structured array we are able to actually make the array much much denser and also use lesser periphery circuits or lesser additional circuits than what you would use in a latch so the structure of all the membranes whether you're cognitive dram or sam or flash would typically have a core array would have decoder region and would have i o region we'll look into it in a little more detail a little later but let us look at the benefit of having a structured core array uh i have a downside yes please uh sir always when it comes to the memory structure will we just have an m cross instructions or is it or do we have any other structures oh so there will be many structures this is the most rudimentary basic structure that i'm introducing you to over here in this class when we go to memory design course you will see there are hierarchical architectures there are other structures also but still you know this basic net that there is an array of there is a cluster of storage elements which are closely coupled which are closely coupled not only through world line but also through bit lines that then it remains constant okay that there is some decoding architecture there that in it remains constant that there are ios which would have struck which would have circuits to buffer the output that in it remains constant that there is some brain some control region somewhere that remains constant so since these tenets remain constant we start with a very basic architecture okay we can go into much more complex architectures and we do go in the course itself we do go okay okay yeah so if we look at this basic architecture only where we have a control decoders array and ios this control region is the brain of the memory okay this would have uh circuits which would tell whether it is a read operation so if it is a read operation it will tell okay activate this set of signals if it is the right operation it will say activate the other set of signals if it is a dummy operation it would say okay save power and all that so this control region you may say is the brain of the mmg it controls the state machine so in a memory you could do multiple operations say in a latch or in a flop you would just trigger the clock and the latch will be written into and it will also output in the same cycle or whatever will happen in a memory by the virtue of you know consolidating a big array and everything you separate the read and write operations across cycles you say okay when i want to write i will use one particular set of inputs when i want to read i will use another set of inputs and outputs okay so there are different states that the memory can be in and that is controlled in this control region the control region has what we call as a clock generator and what we call as a some address pre-decoding also in it so when the addresses come they are pre-decoded and when the clock comes an internal clock is generated these pre-decoded addresses and the internal clock go to what is called as a post decoder and this is generic again across all memories you will have this now how many post decoders you have what is the architecture that may change but you will still always have a post decoder okay the post decoder would generate what we call as a word line it will select a particular row when a particular row is selected the memory cells the storage elements stored in that particular row will discharge bit lines now in this case because i'm starting to talk about srams i'm showing a differential you know a pair of bit lines bit line and bit line bar but in srams also you have single ended just so just one bit line per memory cell and then when you talk about roms and when we talk about drams and when we talk about flash memories you would typically have only one bit line per memory cell why don't we have two bit lines in those roms and drams you've done layouts now if i have to route two metals versus one metal what is denser so we want to keep as as dense you know we talk about uh roms to be very very dense d ramps to be very very dense flash to be very very dense so for that purpose we do not go for differential bit lines there but when you select a memory cell some bit line would discharge and that discharge you will measure you will estimate and you will observe at what is called as a sense amplifier okay so once the discharge has happened you trigger the sense amplifier and you output you use you output the uh the differential or you enhance the differential and you give a zero one output on the q pin okay so this is a typical read operation as it would happen inside a memory when you talk about a write operation you will still have word line selection the way we talked about talked about but you will also have another clock going from here and you will have what you call as a write driver so data will come from outside and right driver will discharge one of the bit lines either bit line or bit line bar and that would be written into the memory cell there okay any questions here okay so again this is just to give you an intuitive feel of how uh different components or how a signal flow uh you know a clock flows inside the memory to do a accomplish a complete read and write operation okay so this is a d latch how many transistors can you count in it quickly 14 transition 14 transistors but do you notice that of these 14 transistors there are a few transistors which are not really needed or there are a few transistors which could actually be shared across memory cells for example consider the case where word line is not selected or where the clock is not coming so clock is zero means both these p moses are on am i right if these c moses are on then i am effectively having vdd directly over here so in a way these four p masses are not required 99 of time because for a memory the clock would come rarely so you have 1000 words in a memory even if you access memory in every cycle any any particular word will be accessed only one and one thousand times so more than ninety nine percent of times this pmos is not getting selected this like these p masses are simply waste vdd is already coming here are you able to see this friends if you don't ask questions the questions will simply linger on in your minds is this clear are you able to understand why i said that 99 percent of times the seeker is zero for a particular memory storage element is that part clear these p moses but said as you said the one person case what is what will be that alternative way to implement that one percent case yeah so you tell me if i if i do not use a full cmos circuit what do i do we have already done some such circuits where we were not using full cmos so what were the constraints that were coming on our way so like we can use a domino logic or something that okay we do not want to make a dram we want to use static logic only so what was the static method in which we were not using the pmos stack or not using the pmos pmos is as many p masses you are using the suitor and uh pseudo nmos and what was the challenge of designing pseudo nmos rising so as soon as i remove these four p masses i have a pseudo nmo circuit then what this means is that i have to size my devices very carefully are you able to see this yes so these four four p masses are not required for 99.9 percent of time therefore you say i remove them but for that point one percent you still don't want to fail and for that you have to do the sizing okay okay sir yeah so vaishnav what did you not understand you said yes sir in any cycle you will access one word yes sir so the remaining 1000 words or 999 words then again 99 okay like log cycles may configure together i'll be clearing yeah so now for the 99 percent of cells the clock is not coming no yes sir yes yes okay in reality this is 99.99 something still higher yes yes but you can't let that one percent or 0.1 percent of 0.01 also fail that is where you need to be careful about the sizing that is where sizing comes into picture yes sir,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-sJ1vuRj2E,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-sJ1vuRj2E
Transcript: about sense amplifier today okay so why memories like we talked about the entire library we talked about some arithmetic circuits then why memories why is what is so important about memories that we're talking about in dvd course also certain memories are the minimalistic storage elements which provides high density so if we consider a case of a resistor or a latch for a flip-flop then those involve large number of transistors even though they provide the storage functionality that they don't provide the high package density so we need to specifically look into the models thank you ranjit so you already made my task a little easier in the sense that what we are saying is that uh memories are high density storage elements and they are so important that today they cover uh you know in in advanced socs they cover up to 70 to 80 percent of chip area so come to think of it all that you've discussed in this course both libraries and everything that is not even 20 of total chip area do you see that and and since memories cover that huge area or have such a huge footprint on a chip we talk about memories in this course also and that is also the reason why we have a separate course all together on memories that will be running in the next semester so uh why is it that memories consume so much of area or why so much of area is given to memories see in a typical computer architecture you will see that memories are there at various levels there are register files which could be shift registers but which could also be small small memories there are caches of different level of hierarchy first level cache which is integrated inside the processor it operates at the same speed as the processor it has to operate uh that like it would possibly access every cycle and if you've done the course on computer architecture you also know that there is an instruction cache there is a data cache and there could be the concept of a unified cache also so there are these caches level one cache level two cache level three cache and all that so all this is on chip and then outside the chip also then you have main memory which which would typically be dram we will cover about dram also in the memory design course and beyond the dram there will be non-volt non-volatile storage the pendrives that you have where you would store your data so do you realize that memories are kind of pervasive as we move away from the processors they are also becoming slower so while resistor files operate at the data path speed are really really very very fast number one caches operate at processor speed the second level caches may actually take multiple processor cycles third level caching materials takes still longer and as you go to main memory which is off chip the time duration or the time of access increases multi multi-fold okay so it would take hundreds of cycles to access a dram from a chip so how you size these memories and how you organize this architecture is critical and you look quite a you you look into quite a bit of it i hope uh in detail in the computer architecture course how many of you have done the ca course and uh have you covered these different hierarchy architectures different hierarchies and memory architecture so raising hands to tell me that you have done the course and you understand this or you are raising hands to ask questions so please ask ranjit oh no sorry it was just to indicate okay akash that was also to indicate yes that's us okay just two of you have done cia course others have not done computer architecture i'm very surprised okay so the chat window says class runs okay i get it so many of you have done the cfos and you do understand that memory hierarchy is is critical to managers important to manage in mdt course we'll spend just about a lecture or two on on memory hierarchy and how to size this up because we have already covered it and see it but we will actually spend more time on how to design the level one cache or level two cache or you know the dram so that you get the you you achieve the desired objective whether it is high density or high speed or low power whatever it is so uh and just already mentioned that uh the standard you know the the latches and the flip flops they take much more area than a standard 60 memory cell so we will come to just that but before that when we talk about memories we also need to realize that whether it is resistor fires or l1 l2 caches or l3 caches there are different kinds of memories that come into picture one set of memory is random access which are static rams and drams but then on any chip you would also have stuff like free force have you heard about first in first out c4s which are used to implement queues you also have last and first outs which are used to implement stacks so when you have when you do programming you must have definitely uh you know in data structures courses you must know about stacks so there are memories which would be used to implement stacks then there are shift registers which you already know and then there are content addressable memories you know what is a cam have you ever heard about it earlier no sir yes sir okay huh okay who has said okay can you tell us about it what is it yes so it is a type of associated memory that is used for high speed searching applications it is means it basically finds the data and returns the address of matching data great so uh see typically when you talk of a memory you would typically give an address location and you would want to find out what is written on that particular address a cam is something different cam does not know what the address is cam knows what the content is so you search for the content and that leads you to the address and then from that address you may do further operations now where is it needed consider the case of a of a network router a network switch you know that you want to route some packet of data to google's us office so you want that you know that the destination is us but in a particular routing switch all that you can tell is that okay out of these four switches which one would take me closer to the us destination to the us server so you search for us in the content and whatever programmation or whatever programming has been done at the at the router level it will tell you oh go to port number 25 it will route your packet to port number 25. now you switch the router off you turn it on again next time around it may route you to port number 29 port number 2 wherever whatever has been configured so depending on data you will get a different address to go to to send your packet to that is what is content addressable memory this is also very widely or like content addressable memories are are tightly coupled to processors so that when when a particular instruction is given the follow-up instructions are brought in quickly based on the content the you know the locate by by doing a quick content search as to which location is this particular instruction stored and then i pull out remaining instructions from that region quickly so cams are specific memories and we will not really talk about them much in the course but just for the sake of completeness tams are also non-random access read write memories now while these are read write memories and these are all volatile now like volatile means that when you switch off the power the contents will get erased so when you power up the circuit again you will need to write the memory right inside the memory all over again but you don't want but or you also need memories which would not erase all the data is it not that is where we have nv read write memories that is non-volatile read write memories these include electric electrically programmable roms electrically erasable programmable roms and flash memories so what is the use of these flash and eeproms and eproms anyone so these memories uh firstly they provide the non-volatility and the second thing is that this can uh these are facilitate the large number of rights so they can be arrested and right written yeah so uh eproms over here cannot be raised but ee prompts can be raised so eproms are electrically programmable roms so what you do here is you kind of blow away the fuses once the fuse is blown now you cannot rebuild it again so eeproms where would they be used can you think of a use case boot sequence yes boot sequence or for example uh there is a standard set-top box chip which you also sell to airtel and you would sell to bharti and you said to tata sky and you sell to this tv and everyone now this tv wants to program such that people cannot use their set-top box or their dish tv their their box with let's say tata style so they will use the eprom there to program the the memory and prevent access from any other provider to this particular box eeproms would also allow erase they could be for example for boot code where we say that okay it may happen that i want to give a firmware update one year down the line so i should have the flexibility to erase also so eeproms would be used there and then flash flash all of you know where would you use flash where would you use flash there are memory cards and everything has flashed your cell phone has a flash everything all the solid-state storage that we talk about is with flash so then there are roms roms are read-only memories you cannot write into them where do you use a rom against data and all in those boot sequence and and and those parts where you are just stored which address location for example you would go to to get the first output or stuff like that so boot sequence would typically be stored in roms this you cannot change once it is programmed you cannot change it all the code memory will be of type now yes so this is this is the wide range of memories that exist so we will talk about as i mentioned srams will talk about b rams lifos c4 shift resistors and cams will not talk about as much uh but we will talk about eprom's eeproms flash and then roms when we would when we will do the mdt course there okay now when we talk about these different onset memories and off-chip memories so on-chip memories are typically srams whether we are talking of l1 cache l2 cache lc cache when it is onset it is typically srans they are very fast but they are not as dense we talk about six transistor estrangs you've heard about 60 sram cells 60 sram cells no one yes sir so it has two transistors to control the bit lines and the two back to back coupled in motors yeah so 60 transistor cells so we are talking about six transistors to save one bit of data when we talk about drams drams are one transistor and one capacitor and flash flash is actually effectively less than one transistor per bit of data on every transistor you could actually be storing two bits or even three bits of data and that is where it is much more dense endurance means the number of times you can read write into that particular memory so in a sram it is six transistors fully static cmos logic regular voltage operation endurance is maximum very high level of endurance uh d dams again very high level of endurance even though we have a capacitor uh which could leak a little but even then the endurance is very high but flash we actually when we will you know do the course we will see that we in flash we actually use very high voltages and therefore endurance goes bad we cannot really do as many number of reads and writes as you can do in a sram so there are various figures of merit you know speed density endurance power refresh so what does refresh mean what does refresh mean anyone restoring the data that was stored stored on this cell yes refresh means that if you do not restore the data on a on a regular basis then what happens if you do not restore the data on a regular basis you may actually end up losing data you may actually end up losing information so you have to refresh and drams because they store data on a capacitor it's a floating capacitor uh that can leak this this charge can leak therefore you need to refresh the dram the contents of a dr okay retention we already talked about as you switch off the power would go off and and the contents would be erased and then mechanism is by stable latch or a capacitor or in a flash with using a mechanism like fn tunneling or hot carrier injection to to be able to do read and write operation okay faizal you have a question so first thing is uh when we were talking about flash he was saying uh on one transistor we will store two to three bits so how is that possible like a transistor magic so we have a floating gate there we use like uh you know till now we've just looked at a gate oxide and then the substrate yes and flash we use special kind of devices where you have gate one you have silicon dioxide you have gate two you have silicon dioxide and then you have the substrate is it like the floating gate or something sorry fg was huh floating it was yeah so you have a floating gate there in which you can trap charges okay okay yes sir when you trap charges the vt would change and then you will be able to say that what is the kind of uh data stored there okay and so one more thing can you please reiterate why do we need to refresh because in these rams you're storing data on a capacitor it's like a dynamic gate so why did you need to use a keeper there because that data would leak some charge sharing can happen something can happen some mishap can happen due to which that data can be lost so you put a keeper in a dynamic gate is it not yes yes sir now for a dram if you start to put keepers in every cell then you will become a 2t1c cell area would double we don't want that yes sir therefore we say okay we will keep one t and one c but every now and then we will refresh the data we will restart we will put the charge on the capacitor again yes okay underfoot thank you sir yeah so that's a quick overview of different kinds of memories that we have but whatever be the kind of memory you will see that we can still cover them in one course because they are organized in a very standard way what you have is a structured array of storage elements which are accessed you know if let us say we are storing one word in this particular row then we have a decoder which would select a particular word and we have ios which would give out the output so by putting them in a structured array we are able to actually make the array much much denser and also use lesser periphery circuits or lesser additional circuits than what you would use in a latch so the structure of all the membranes whether you're cognitive dram or sam or flash would typically have a core array would have decoder region and would have i o region we'll look into it in a little more detail a little later but let us look at the benefit of having a structured core array uh i have a downside yes please uh sir always when it comes to the memory structure will we just have an m cross instructions or is it or do we have any other structures oh so there will be many structures this is the most rudimentary basic structure that i'm introducing you to over here in this class when we go to memory design course you will see there are hierarchical architectures there are other structures also but still you know this basic net that there is an array of there is a cluster of storage elements which are closely coupled which are closely coupled not only through world line but also through bit lines that then it remains constant okay that there is some decoding architecture there that in it remains constant that there are ios which would have struck which would have circuits to buffer the output that in it remains constant that there is some brain some control region somewhere that remains constant so since these tenets remain constant we start with a very basic architecture okay we can go into much more complex architectures and we do go in the course itself we do go okay okay yeah so if we look at this basic architecture only where we have a control decoders array and ios this control region is the brain of the memory okay this would have uh circuits which would tell whether it is a read operation so if it is a read operation it will tell okay activate this set of signals if it is the right operation it will say activate the other set of signals if it is a dummy operation it would say okay save power and all that so this control region you may say is the brain of the mmg it controls the state machine so in a memory you could do multiple operations say in a latch or in a flop you would just trigger the clock and the latch will be written into and it will also output in the same cycle or whatever will happen in a memory by the virtue of you know consolidating a big array and everything you separate the read and write operations across cycles you say okay when i want to write i will use one particular set of inputs when i want to read i will use another set of inputs and outputs okay so there are different states that the memory can be in and that is controlled in this control region the control region has what we call as a clock generator and what we call as a some address pre-decoding also in it so when the addresses come they are pre-decoded and when the clock comes an internal clock is generated these pre-decoded addresses and the internal clock go to what is called as a post decoder and this is generic again across all memories you will have this now how many post decoders you have what is the architecture that may change but you will still always have a post decoder okay the post decoder would generate what we call as a word line it will select a particular row when a particular row is selected the memory cells the storage elements stored in that particular row will discharge bit lines now in this case because i'm starting to talk about srams i'm showing a differential you know a pair of bit lines bit line and bit line bar but in srams also you have single ended just so just one bit line per memory cell and then when you talk about roms and when we talk about drams and when we talk about flash memories you would typically have only one bit line per memory cell why don't we have two bit lines in those roms and drams you've done layouts now if i have to route two metals versus one metal what is denser so we want to keep as as dense you know we talk about uh roms to be very very dense d ramps to be very very dense flash to be very very dense so for that purpose we do not go for differential bit lines there but when you select a memory cell some bit line would discharge and that discharge you will measure you will estimate and you will observe at what is called as a sense amplifier okay so once the discharge has happened you trigger the sense amplifier and you output you use you output the uh the differential or you enhance the differential and you give a zero one output on the q pin okay so this is a typical read operation as it would happen inside a memory when you talk about a write operation you will still have word line selection the way we talked about talked about but you will also have another clock going from here and you will have what you call as a write driver so data will come from outside and right driver will discharge one of the bit lines either bit line or bit line bar and that would be written into the memory cell there okay any questions here okay so again this is just to give you an intuitive feel of how uh different components or how a signal flow uh you know a clock flows inside the memory to do a accomplish a complete read and write operation okay so this is a d latch how many transistors can you count in it quickly 14 transition 14 transistors but do you notice that of these 14 transistors there are a few transistors which are not really needed or there are a few transistors which could actually be shared across memory cells for example consider the case where word line is not selected or where the clock is not coming so clock is zero means both these p moses are on am i right if these c moses are on then i am effectively having vdd directly over here so in a way these four p masses are not required 99 of time because for a memory the clock would come rarely so you have 1000 words in a memory even if you access memory in every cycle any any particular word will be accessed only one and one thousand times so more than ninety nine percent of times this pmos is not getting selected this like these p masses are simply waste vdd is already coming here are you able to see this friends if you don't ask questions the questions will simply linger on in your minds is this clear are you able to understand why i said that 99 percent of times the seeker is zero for a particular memory storage element is that part clear these p moses but said as you said the one person case what is what will be that alternative way to implement that one percent case yeah so you tell me if i if i do not use a full cmos circuit what do i do we have already done some such circuits where we were not using full cmos so what were the constraints that were coming on our way so like we can use a domino logic or something that okay we do not want to make a dram we want to use static logic only so what was the static method in which we were not using the pmos stack or not using the pmos pmos is as many p masses you are using the suitor and uh pseudo nmos and what was the challenge of designing pseudo nmos rising so as soon as i remove these four p masses i have a pseudo nmo circuit then what this means is that i have to size my devices very carefully are you able to see this yes so these four four p masses are not required for 99.9 percent of time therefore you say i remove them but for that point one percent you still don't want to fail and for that you have to do the sizing okay okay sir yeah so vaishnav what did you not understand you said yes sir in any cycle you will access one word yes sir so the remaining 1000 words or 999 words then again 99 okay like log cycles may configure together i'll be clearing yeah so now for the 99 percent of cells the clock is not coming no yes sir yes yes okay in reality this is 99.99 something still higher yes yes but you can't let that one percent or 0.1 percent of 0.01 also fail that is where you need to be careful about the sizing that is where sizing comes into picture yes sir"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,v1yO56zfo9w,thank you okay so what we therefore use in srams is this six transistor set over here what has been done is you know this inverter is there this inverter is there then this clock transistor has been taken up and this clock is now called word line okay and this d transistor has been removed and put in a common area which is called the i o region remember i said there is a right driver where d would come so this this transistor this b the d n mass has been put in the right driver now so what has happened is that what you are repeating millions of times in a storage in a storage uh memory is not these 14 transistors but only these six and you have a 60 memory cell so this word line is nothing but the clock this is the inverter that we talked about where we said that these pmoses have been removed and this bit lines these bit lines actually represent the internal nodes over here this node such that the data that the n-mosses of the data are in the right driver down below are you able to see this that a 60 memory cell is a minimized latch nothing else any questions okay great so now how do you read and write into this latch so to be able to read into this latch what you do is you first pre-charge the bit lines so these are bit lines and bit line bars you you p charge them and you take over line to be high when this particular set of analysis are turned on because word line went high what happens they start to connect bit lines and the internal nodes this side stores a zero and this side you precharge to vdd what will happen some current flow would happen as that current flows bit line would discharge bl bar because this is also 1 and this is also 1 bl bar would not change and it is this differential that is created that you will sense at the sense amplifier to complete the read operation are you able to see this any questions sir please explain the workings okay so what are we saying is that even before you select the word line you pre-charge you maintain the bit lines at a particular value so these bit lines are as we just shared internal nodes they are simply capacitors so you pre-charge them to a particular value and then when you turn the word line on the side on which zero was stored that particular side the bit line would discharge so one of the bit line remains our vdd because on that side one was written the other other bit line starts to fall from the one level and you measure the differential generated and that is how you say okay i am storing a 0 or a 1 inside this memory cell so if bl discharges you say it is a 0 if blb discharges you say it is a 1 or vice versa ok yes yes sir uh i understood sir but uh why are we exactly discharging this beer sir i mean what sex otherwise how will you make out what is written inside the memory set oh yes sir you want to read nah yes yes yes sir understood so this is a read operation okay so now how do we write into the memory cell let's say in the same memory cell where 0 was written on the blti node now if i want to write a different data what it means is that bit i should go to 1 and blf i should go to 0. now what would you do see you have this nmos which would connect bit lines to the internal node what would you do you want to write a 0 and you want to write a 1 what would you write on the bit line hello sorry can you charge up the bitcoin i'm asking you see in the read operation we recharged both the bit lines to one then we said okay the side which stores the zero that will discharge the bit line and we will know whether it is a zero or a one yes sir now i want to write inside the memory yes and i have those nmos pass gates yes what would i write on the bit line now to be able to do a complete write inside the memory uh sir we'll set the bit line so if you want to write a one we'll set the bit line high by the right driver and we'll now turn on the board so that is right underneath what about bit line bar yeah bit line bar will be the complement of it which will be written okay so in the read cycle both bit line and bit line bar were written to one however in the write cycle you will put them at a value which is desired for example if you want to write a one on particular bit line on a particular side you would maintain that bit line to be one and the other bit side bit line side you will put a zero and then what happens look at it see n mass will transfer zero much more efficiently than a 1. so what happens is when you take the word line high after keeping one of the bit lines to 0 the node 1 discharges fast on the other side the node 0 will only charge the charger just a little because it is an nmos through an nmos once node 1 has completely discharged that is when like you see this pmos turns on and that is when the write operation has completed so initially there is only some charge that can come from the bit line it cannot really take 0 to 1. unless this comes into picture you will see your write operation cannot complete you will never be able to go to full vdd unless you have pmos coming into picture there so can we say that writing one would take more time than writing zero like as you have just explained very good very very good this is this is what it will take because to be able to write a one you first need to write a zero and then only one will be written otherwise one cannot even be written very good any questions about the right operation okay so this is how we would do the read and write inside the memory and uh then for the memory cells we have multiple figures of merit see just hold that parallel will look at the figures of merit for a memory we looked at speed power area refresh endurance so many things there are many figures of merit length to bit cell also for example cell current cell current is a figure of merit that tells how quickly my bit line will discharge during the read operation so it will control read speed bit line leakage is about power and to some extent also about read speed cell stability so what happens see when you so cell current let's just quickly go through the figures of merit cell current is about as i said speed the speed at which the bit lines can discharge and it is essentially determined by the stack the sizing of this stack the bigger the devices the more current there would be but realize the bigger these devices more is the leakage also more is the capacitance of the bit line also so we cannot simply keep on increasing the size cell stability is one of the most important specification of any storage element whether it is a flip flop or a latch or a memory set and the challenge is highest during read operation because during read operation you expose your latch your storage element to external noise what happens is that when you start a read operation current starts to flow like this when a current flows see this was initially storing the zero but to ensure that a current flows this value will go from 0 to vx a value higher than zero otherwise there would be no current flow and as this goes to a level higher than vx a hal a level higher than zero it can actually turn on the devices on this side turn off the pmos on this side and so on okay and that is where risk starts to appear so the cell stability starts to degrade you wish to ensure that this vx is as low as possible therefore we get another sizing constraint over here which is that pass gate has to be much more resistive than the pull down so this is the pass gate this is the pull down the pass gate has to be much more resistive than the pull down if pull down is more resistive then what happens this node will rise above vdd by two and it will kind of flip the contents of the memory cell we don't want that to happen so there was this question now the if you remove those p masses what happens so we already start to see that there are sizing constraints that would come otherwise the memory memory cell operation will start to get hampered are you able to see this any questions okay so the next figure of merit that we are concerned about is right margin right margin essentially means that uh see what are we trying to do we said that this bit line would go to zero and then this internal node will discharge so can can you really disage a capacitor to zero see what is this bit line is a rc this is a wire so which it would have some r and the wire also has some capacitance if i apply a voltage source here or a current source here how long do you think it will take to discharge this particular capacitance to zero how long you realize that it being an rc circuit uh it it will take a huge amount of time to discharge the capacitor to zero are you able to see this okay let us wait until you see this yes sir it's first order differential equation so it takes infinite practically according to the equation it takes infinite amount of time to discharge about them now do you have that kind of time when you want to read or write a memory no you want to operate your memory at one gigahertz so what happens you say that oh i cannot really discharge my bitline to zero what is the highest level of bit line at which i will still be able to write into the memory set is it 50 millivolts that i discharge only up to 50 millivolts and i will still be able to write or is it 100 millivolts and you will realize that as you have a better right margin you can actually operate much faster because you do not really need to go through all those rc delays now instead of 6rc you can go at 5rc and still be able to write inside the memory are you able to see this so right margin is also a metric of speed it is a metric of writability whether i can actually write into the memory cell at all or not and in the course and we'll look at it we will also look at it look at the advanced technologies where right margin is actually negative what it means is you need to take bitline at a voltage which is lower than zero to be able to write into the memory set and we will talk about negative bit line write assist schemes in the course okay so when you want to write into the memory you want to say that this improve the right margin you need to say that this pull up should not be able to drive or should drive lesser current than what this stack of as gate and right driver can sink through it are you able to see this that the series of pass gate and dry driver has to be stronger than the pull up are you able to see this constraint yes sir okay so here every do you realize now that we're talking about uh size of pass gate pull down and in this particular case we are also brought in the pull up the pmos into the picture there and if we know if we know all these three sets of constraints you will realize that designing the memory cell even though it is only six transistors is not a simple task that is why we have numerous people working on optimizing the memory cell for the densest memory or for highest speed memory and so on okay uh leakage is a part of power consumption all of devices in a bit cell leak on devices also have junction leakage there is gate leakage also so to have low leakage you want to use as small devices as possible so that junction leakage is minimized huh great leakage is minimized so you want to use as small devices as is possible to reduce leakage you can also use long channel devices so typically in industrial sram cell you will notice that if the minimum channel length allowed by a technology is let us say x then the the length that is used inside the memory cell would almost always be more than 10 or 20 more than this x it will be 1.2 x or 1.3 x also at times okay so the length is always length of memory cell transistors is always larger than the minimum length so that you can reduce the leakage there okay and you will find in some papers that people also talk about using thick gate oxides so that you can reduce gate leakage in how do i put it when one in the high k metal gate technologies the requirement of thick gate oxide usage has reduced a bit but even then uh even for a high k metal gate stack if you use a thick gate oxide you can reduce leakage a bit because of reduced paneling okay uh any questions still here because now i am coming to the concept of butterfly curve have you heard about a butterfly curve in reference to a latch what is a butterfly curve any idea okay so let us say we just have two inverters over here you you see this switch is open so we do not have a latch we just have two inverters in one in two and out two are the three nodes that we are talking about over here if we look at the transfer characters of the two inverters what do we see that as n1 rises into would fall then as n2 rises as in two rises out two would fall are you with me on this these are the transfer practices of these two inverters is that clear any questions still here okay so uh what do we do we say the memory serka we have to find the stability of a memory cell in a memory cell there are these two inverters are connected back to back so what we do is we close the switch as soon as we close the switch now n1 is no longer connected however that n1 is replaced by out 2 so as out 2 rises in 2 falls the other curve was already between out 2 and n2 now realize that we are talking about for this circuit we are talking about two curves that relate out two and n two and if i merge them one over the other what would happen they would simply come one over another and what you would have is a butterfly curve so this latch is characterized by the transfer function of this latch is a butterfly curve are you able to see this yes sir so now what is important to realize is how much noise can i put in there that is what is meant by cell stability now that how much noise can i be immune to the more noise i am able to handle the more stable the sellers more stable the latches so now let us go to another level of abstraction we say that this latch you know if i am storing a zero on one side and one on the other the worst case noise that i need to inject is zero going towards one and one being reduced and going towards zero that is the worst case noise pair that i can inject on this particular latch are you with me this is the right assumption this is the worst case for the latch for noise injection so now is it okay if i say that this latch is essentially a long chain of inverters which are storing 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 can i say it like that so why where n1 is equal to n3 is equal to n5 they are all connected so there is this loop see i give a small noise here this noise can get increased over here then out 2 would increase that noise further so this small noise has increased and it is now fed back into this inverter okay so noise is actually fine is it sorry so noise is amplifying itself you can't amplify now yes sir yes sir i don't know a latch latches amplifying action is it not yeah right into a latch so i can amplify it now if i just keep one picture then i am not able to overlap this big noise and small noise however this big noise will actually go to this inverter now and will cause much more havoc is it not so just to make my work simple what i'm trying to do is i'm just opening this latch into a series of inverters can i do that just for sake of understanding we know that n1 equal to n3 equal to n5 and all that we know this so what happens now it means that if n1 was given a positive noise then n3 also is given a positive noise and n5 also is given a positive noise and same applies for n2 and 4 and n6 that will be the worst case am i right yes sir now if we plot the butterfly curve now see this will be in one and three and five this will be in two and four and six and so on in this butterfly curve let me say i injected noise onto n1 so in one say on this axis i injected a noise here so when n one was zero uh this particular curve was being followed are you with me so i injected a noise what happened in 2 became slightly lower than 0. slightly lower than 1 on n2 i injected the opposite side of noise so what happened when n2 went to further lower value n1 became slightly greater than 0. now on n3 i inject that noise again when i inject noise on n3 n2 comes here so initially it was here now it has come here i inject noise on n4 and you will see that there will come a point when they will just move between this i cannot go any further because in 4b informal noise dollar so i am just stuck in this loop here are you able to see this so it means that my circuit is safe for this amount of noise if this amount of noise comes then i stored 0 on n1 okay that 0 will go to this value and i have stored 1 on n2 that in that one would go to slightly lower than that but i will still have 0 and 1 are you able to see this any questions so the point that where they will converge like they will start repeating each other is this noise it is not getting troubled this noise is safe yes sir this is definite this noise is definitely less than the noise margin that we could think of i have more noise margins than this noise this much i can say yes now let's increase the amount of noise let us say i put in that much of noise so then in the next cycle what happens to n2 into would put this kind of noise so in one has now come here now again i will put noise on this into will come here again i will put now infor will come there in 4k i will now put a noise so it will go on to this curve you see in 5 is almost close to vdd by 2 now but i have to inject noise on n5 as soon as i injected noise on n5 what happened my n5 was almost now it was already close to vdd by two it has now grown beyond vdd by two and my n6 is now almost zero it was meant to be one but it is almost zero the next noise and i am fully at zero i have completely flipped so for this value of noise my circuit is not stable so noise margin is somewhere between the first case and this case are you able to see this yes sir so what is that what is that unique case which we would call as noise margin that unique case would appear something like this okay i put some noise there there there there and here now this is the largest square that i can fit into these lobes if there are two asymmetrical lobes then the smaller square is the noise margin because i have shown you symmetrical loops the noise margin on both the sides are same but you can come across cells where the lobes are asymmetrical so you may say this is the noise margin no this is the noise margin because if this was the data that you were storing only this amount of noise could toggle it into the other side are you able to see this so for memories or for latches people will talk about butterfly curve so you should now be able to answer what a butterfly curve is and when they talk about stability or noise margin you should be able to tell that the stability can be measured by fitting the largest square in the smaller lobe of the butterfly curve is this thing clear any questions sir,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1yO56zfo9w,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1yO56zfo9w
Transcript: thank you okay so what we therefore use in srams is this six transistor set over here what has been done is you know this inverter is there this inverter is there then this clock transistor has been taken up and this clock is now called word line okay and this d transistor has been removed and put in a common area which is called the i o region remember i said there is a right driver where d would come so this this transistor this b the d n mass has been put in the right driver now so what has happened is that what you are repeating millions of times in a storage in a storage uh memory is not these 14 transistors but only these six and you have a 60 memory cell so this word line is nothing but the clock this is the inverter that we talked about where we said that these pmoses have been removed and this bit lines these bit lines actually represent the internal nodes over here this node such that the data that the n-mosses of the data are in the right driver down below are you able to see this that a 60 memory cell is a minimized latch nothing else any questions okay great so now how do you read and write into this latch so to be able to read into this latch what you do is you first pre-charge the bit lines so these are bit lines and bit line bars you you p charge them and you take over line to be high when this particular set of analysis are turned on because word line went high what happens they start to connect bit lines and the internal nodes this side stores a zero and this side you precharge to vdd what will happen some current flow would happen as that current flows bit line would discharge bl bar because this is also 1 and this is also 1 bl bar would not change and it is this differential that is created that you will sense at the sense amplifier to complete the read operation are you able to see this any questions sir please explain the workings okay so what are we saying is that even before you select the word line you pre-charge you maintain the bit lines at a particular value so these bit lines are as we just shared internal nodes they are simply capacitors so you pre-charge them to a particular value and then when you turn the word line on the side on which zero was stored that particular side the bit line would discharge so one of the bit line remains our vdd because on that side one was written the other other bit line starts to fall from the one level and you measure the differential generated and that is how you say okay i am storing a 0 or a 1 inside this memory cell so if bl discharges you say it is a 0 if blb discharges you say it is a 1 or vice versa ok yes yes sir uh i understood sir but uh why are we exactly discharging this beer sir i mean what sex otherwise how will you make out what is written inside the memory set oh yes sir you want to read nah yes yes yes sir understood so this is a read operation okay so now how do we write into the memory cell let's say in the same memory cell where 0 was written on the blti node now if i want to write a different data what it means is that bit i should go to 1 and blf i should go to 0. now what would you do see you have this nmos which would connect bit lines to the internal node what would you do you want to write a 0 and you want to write a 1 what would you write on the bit line hello sorry can you charge up the bitcoin i'm asking you see in the read operation we recharged both the bit lines to one then we said okay the side which stores the zero that will discharge the bit line and we will know whether it is a zero or a one yes sir now i want to write inside the memory yes and i have those nmos pass gates yes what would i write on the bit line now to be able to do a complete write inside the memory uh sir we'll set the bit line so if you want to write a one we'll set the bit line high by the right driver and we'll now turn on the board so that is right underneath what about bit line bar yeah bit line bar will be the complement of it which will be written okay so in the read cycle both bit line and bit line bar were written to one however in the write cycle you will put them at a value which is desired for example if you want to write a one on particular bit line on a particular side you would maintain that bit line to be one and the other bit side bit line side you will put a zero and then what happens look at it see n mass will transfer zero much more efficiently than a 1. so what happens is when you take the word line high after keeping one of the bit lines to 0 the node 1 discharges fast on the other side the node 0 will only charge the charger just a little because it is an nmos through an nmos once node 1 has completely discharged that is when like you see this pmos turns on and that is when the write operation has completed so initially there is only some charge that can come from the bit line it cannot really take 0 to 1. unless this comes into picture you will see your write operation cannot complete you will never be able to go to full vdd unless you have pmos coming into picture there so can we say that writing one would take more time than writing zero like as you have just explained very good very very good this is this is what it will take because to be able to write a one you first need to write a zero and then only one will be written otherwise one cannot even be written very good any questions about the right operation okay so this is how we would do the read and write inside the memory and uh then for the memory cells we have multiple figures of merit see just hold that parallel will look at the figures of merit for a memory we looked at speed power area refresh endurance so many things there are many figures of merit length to bit cell also for example cell current cell current is a figure of merit that tells how quickly my bit line will discharge during the read operation so it will control read speed bit line leakage is about power and to some extent also about read speed cell stability so what happens see when you so cell current let's just quickly go through the figures of merit cell current is about as i said speed the speed at which the bit lines can discharge and it is essentially determined by the stack the sizing of this stack the bigger the devices the more current there would be but realize the bigger these devices more is the leakage also more is the capacitance of the bit line also so we cannot simply keep on increasing the size cell stability is one of the most important specification of any storage element whether it is a flip flop or a latch or a memory set and the challenge is highest during read operation because during read operation you expose your latch your storage element to external noise what happens is that when you start a read operation current starts to flow like this when a current flows see this was initially storing the zero but to ensure that a current flows this value will go from 0 to vx a value higher than zero otherwise there would be no current flow and as this goes to a level higher than vx a hal a level higher than zero it can actually turn on the devices on this side turn off the pmos on this side and so on okay and that is where risk starts to appear so the cell stability starts to degrade you wish to ensure that this vx is as low as possible therefore we get another sizing constraint over here which is that pass gate has to be much more resistive than the pull down so this is the pass gate this is the pull down the pass gate has to be much more resistive than the pull down if pull down is more resistive then what happens this node will rise above vdd by two and it will kind of flip the contents of the memory cell we don't want that to happen so there was this question now the if you remove those p masses what happens so we already start to see that there are sizing constraints that would come otherwise the memory memory cell operation will start to get hampered are you able to see this any questions okay so the next figure of merit that we are concerned about is right margin right margin essentially means that uh see what are we trying to do we said that this bit line would go to zero and then this internal node will discharge so can can you really disage a capacitor to zero see what is this bit line is a rc this is a wire so which it would have some r and the wire also has some capacitance if i apply a voltage source here or a current source here how long do you think it will take to discharge this particular capacitance to zero how long you realize that it being an rc circuit uh it it will take a huge amount of time to discharge the capacitor to zero are you able to see this okay let us wait until you see this yes sir it's first order differential equation so it takes infinite practically according to the equation it takes infinite amount of time to discharge about them now do you have that kind of time when you want to read or write a memory no you want to operate your memory at one gigahertz so what happens you say that oh i cannot really discharge my bitline to zero what is the highest level of bit line at which i will still be able to write into the memory set is it 50 millivolts that i discharge only up to 50 millivolts and i will still be able to write or is it 100 millivolts and you will realize that as you have a better right margin you can actually operate much faster because you do not really need to go through all those rc delays now instead of 6rc you can go at 5rc and still be able to write inside the memory are you able to see this so right margin is also a metric of speed it is a metric of writability whether i can actually write into the memory cell at all or not and in the course and we'll look at it we will also look at it look at the advanced technologies where right margin is actually negative what it means is you need to take bitline at a voltage which is lower than zero to be able to write into the memory set and we will talk about negative bit line write assist schemes in the course okay so when you want to write into the memory you want to say that this improve the right margin you need to say that this pull up should not be able to drive or should drive lesser current than what this stack of as gate and right driver can sink through it are you able to see this that the series of pass gate and dry driver has to be stronger than the pull up are you able to see this constraint yes sir okay so here every do you realize now that we're talking about uh size of pass gate pull down and in this particular case we are also brought in the pull up the pmos into the picture there and if we know if we know all these three sets of constraints you will realize that designing the memory cell even though it is only six transistors is not a simple task that is why we have numerous people working on optimizing the memory cell for the densest memory or for highest speed memory and so on okay uh leakage is a part of power consumption all of devices in a bit cell leak on devices also have junction leakage there is gate leakage also so to have low leakage you want to use as small devices as possible so that junction leakage is minimized huh great leakage is minimized so you want to use as small devices as is possible to reduce leakage you can also use long channel devices so typically in industrial sram cell you will notice that if the minimum channel length allowed by a technology is let us say x then the the length that is used inside the memory cell would almost always be more than 10 or 20 more than this x it will be 1.2 x or 1.3 x also at times okay so the length is always length of memory cell transistors is always larger than the minimum length so that you can reduce the leakage there okay and you will find in some papers that people also talk about using thick gate oxides so that you can reduce gate leakage in how do i put it when one in the high k metal gate technologies the requirement of thick gate oxide usage has reduced a bit but even then uh even for a high k metal gate stack if you use a thick gate oxide you can reduce leakage a bit because of reduced paneling okay uh any questions still here because now i am coming to the concept of butterfly curve have you heard about a butterfly curve in reference to a latch what is a butterfly curve any idea okay so let us say we just have two inverters over here you you see this switch is open so we do not have a latch we just have two inverters in one in two and out two are the three nodes that we are talking about over here if we look at the transfer characters of the two inverters what do we see that as n1 rises into would fall then as n2 rises as in two rises out two would fall are you with me on this these are the transfer practices of these two inverters is that clear any questions still here okay so uh what do we do we say the memory serka we have to find the stability of a memory cell in a memory cell there are these two inverters are connected back to back so what we do is we close the switch as soon as we close the switch now n1 is no longer connected however that n1 is replaced by out 2 so as out 2 rises in 2 falls the other curve was already between out 2 and n2 now realize that we are talking about for this circuit we are talking about two curves that relate out two and n two and if i merge them one over the other what would happen they would simply come one over another and what you would have is a butterfly curve so this latch is characterized by the transfer function of this latch is a butterfly curve are you able to see this yes sir so now what is important to realize is how much noise can i put in there that is what is meant by cell stability now that how much noise can i be immune to the more noise i am able to handle the more stable the sellers more stable the latches so now let us go to another level of abstraction we say that this latch you know if i am storing a zero on one side and one on the other the worst case noise that i need to inject is zero going towards one and one being reduced and going towards zero that is the worst case noise pair that i can inject on this particular latch are you with me this is the right assumption this is the worst case for the latch for noise injection so now is it okay if i say that this latch is essentially a long chain of inverters which are storing 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 can i say it like that so why where n1 is equal to n3 is equal to n5 they are all

right into a latch so i can amplify it now if i just keep one picture then i am not able to overlap this big noise and small noise however this big noise will actually go to this inverter now and will cause much more havoc is it not so just to make my work simple what i'm trying to do is i'm just opening this latch into a series of inverters can i do that just for sake of understanding we know that n1 equal to n3 equal to n5 and all that we know this so what happens now it means that if n1 was given a positive noise then n3 also is given a positive noise and n5 also is given a positive noise and same applies for n2 and 4 and n6 that will be the worst case am i right yes sir now if we plot the butterfly curve now see this will be in one and three and five this will be in two and four and six and so on in this butterfly curve let me say i injected noise onto n1 so in one say on this axis i injected a noise here so when n one was zero uh this particular curve was being followed are you with me so i injected a noise what happened in 2 became slightly lower than 0. slightly lower than 1 on n2 i injected the opposite side of noise so what happened when n2 went to further lower value n1 became slightly greater than 0. now on n3 i inject that noise again when i inject noise on n3 n2 comes here so initially it was here now it has come here i inject noise on n4 and you will see that there will come a point when they will just move between this i cannot go any further because in 4b informal noise dollar so i am just stuck in this loop here are you able to see this so it means that my circuit is safe for this amount of noise if this amount of noise comes then i stored 0 on n1 okay that 0 will go to this value and i have stored 1 on n2 that in that one would go to slightly lower than that but i will still have 0 and 1 are you able to see this any questions so the point that where they will converge like they will start repeating each other is this noise it is not getting

inject noise on n5 as soon as i injected noise on n5 what happened my n5 was almost now it was already close to vdd by two it has now grown beyond vdd by two and my n6 is now almost zero it was meant to be one but it is almost zero the next noise and i am fully at zero i have completely flipped so for this value of noise my circuit is not stable so noise margin is somewhere between the first case and this case are you able to see this yes sir so what is that what is that unique case which we would call as noise margin that unique case would appear something like this okay i put some noise there there there there and here now this is the largest square that i can fit into these lobes if there are two asymmetrical lobes then the smaller square is the noise margin because i have shown you

so you should now be able to answer what a butterfly curve is and when they talk about stability or noise margin you should be able to tell that the stability can be measured by fitting the largest square in the smaller lobe of the butterfly curve is this thing clear any questions sir"
PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,t1jI2eLBQ8g,top level view of it we will discuss all this in much more detail in the course okay we can even remove the subtraction from this course just now now what is very important to look at is the layout so you have spent a lot of time working on the layout of the standard sets where we said that for every structure you would want to keep a distance of half DRC from the pr boundary you remember just now in the morning vaishna was asking so contacts can I remove that half DRC rule thus in the morning question I was asking so over there we're talking about no sharing nothing in fact leaving half the RC from the cell boundary memory I would want to talk about the layout because in memories you say that you would want to share as much around the cell boundary as possible because you have a structured array you know that your memory cell is abutted with another memory cell only not that aoi 221 will be abuted with aoi121 you know it is it is another memory cell because you are aware of this and because there is a structured array you actually start to share devices across the cell boundary so if this blue line is the cell boundary you see I share so can you tell me which are the pull downs and which is where is the pull up and where is the pass gate smallest one in the center is the pull up yeah the one in the end well and well would mean that we're talking about CMOS over there so that is the pull up so these two are the Pull-Ups and this connection would then be the connection to vdd then this one the smaller so it means one of these is basket the other one is pull you down from the s m constraint we realized that for cell stability pass gate has to be more resistive than the pull down so the top one is pass gate and over here the bottom one is pass gate and the other devices pull down so this connection would be for the bit line this would be for the bit line bar and then this connection will be for ground and then this would be wordline connections only in memories you use this kind of a long contact you made layouts if you make a rectangular contact what do you see DRC comes so vaishna was talking about contact to contact spacing and how it is impacting the area so in a memory because density is is of importance what we do is instead of putting two contacts one contact separately on the poly and one contact separately on the active and then maintaining a DRC between them we actually kind of merge two contacts and form a long contact and this long contact is allowed to be used only inside a memory why can you do this only inside a memory and not elsewhere any ideas friends uh sir because we are going to drop some drop some vrs very very uh we know we know where where all the points are where we are going to drop the VR so some drcs can be adjusted see we know that this is the only configuration in which you are allowing these long contacts so you can play with the Optics why are these drcs there when we were discussing early on in the course we were talking about drcs and how how we have this 193 nanometer light which is still used to make features which are 28 nanometers wide and and all that is it not so we said that okay because of this large wavelength of light uh putting stuff on mask is very complex so you can't do it therefore the RCs constraining the RCU that poly has to be in One Direction only and this and that and what not now it means that all those rules are largely because of Optics and if the in Optics you can predefine patterns okay then you can make the diffraction plate in such a way that you can still make structures well so by playing with what is called as resolution enhancement techniques we allow large contacts long contacts only inside the SRAM cell because we know that this is going to be available in this array only and nowhere else and in this array also there is a pattern a fixed pattern in which they will be there so I have a clear diffraction pattern for which I have to optimize my mask making process and therefore it is only allowed in the memory cell and nowhere else okay you show the contacts that are closed and violating DRC they should be made in different masks right they should be made in different different masks means if they are made in same mask so uh means if the minimum loss is nowhere nowhere outside the memory you are allowed to wallet any DRC they believe yesterday okay so you not even think about how to do it only inside the memory DRC violations are allowed for the purpose of gaining more density and this is approved or this is designed by the technology team not by you you can only request they will say if they will do it or not if it is possible on Silicon or not can you see okay so you don't even think of violating the RCs not allowed okay shubham so these long contacts you will see only inside the memory cell okay and then you have these metal layers you will see these small small stubs for connecting these contacts to bit lines vdd the word line stubs and the ground so you will notice that now when you made this stuff for ground there is a particular VR which is shared across four memory cells see this contact this VR they were shared across to my research Cooper needs it but this these vrs and contacts which are coming on the corners are shared across four memory cells so violent standard cells you would not allow any sharing in fact if you were to follow standard cell rules you will have to have memory cell which is this big but by allowing the sharing you've reduced the memory area to this much okay and then this is the word lines the word lines are running and you have these stubs for ground so an array then appears to look like this so this is a two cross two array there and that is how you ensure that srams are much much denser than latches and flip flops and other shift resistors that we were talking about in the earlier in the day okay any questions here Okay so with this layout part also done we need to talk about sense amplifiers so whenever you talk about memories you know people talk about bit cells they talk about bit cell stability they talk about bit cell layout those who know memories they will also talk about the layout and then they will talk about the sense amplifier so I'm just giving you a quick one or two slide glimpse of a sense amplifier we said there is a memory array wordline would come it would select a bit cell and that bit cell will discharge a bit line and then I will get to see the output somewhere down there now this bit nine has a huge capacitance on it if I want to discharge this particular bit line there is some you know I had what we said we had to charge this capacitance to vdd I want to discharge it to at least really by 2 to say that I have a zero so what kind of charge are we talking about t v d d by two kind of charge you're talking about and depending on the cell current there is a time huh there is a time it will take to discharge the particular bit line in this particular example that is given you don't need to even go into details you're talking about 7.5 nanoseconds we want to operate your memories are at least one gigahertz you have only one nanosecond available with you so what to do so you say oh I don't want to discharge full vdd to get to less than one nanosecond I can discharge only to vdd by 8 let us say or still lower VD by 10 will divide 12. it's the Lesser I discharge the faster I can be so what do you do you say o so let us put an amplifier down there which would amplify a vdd by 12 discharge into a full VD discharge at the output um that is why a sense amplifier is the motivation for using a sense amplifier clear any questions around that so I'm telling you'll write a story you can read the book and they will tell you a lot of other details I'm just telling it to you like a story so that you can get the intuitive feel of it you will do all the other details when we do the course but since we are touching memories in the DVD course you should know at least these few four three four things five things about memories foreign so we need sense amplifiers to get the speed a sense amplifier is typically a latch again and if you notice this appears to be the same structure as a memory cell except that there is an enable gate there okay so what happens is what happens is you discharge the bit line and that discharge starts to appear on the internal nodes of the sense amplifier when you have the sufficient discharge for this latch to operate you turn this enable signal on so till that time this was not a latch because the enable was off there was no ground Supply coming there but when the sufficient differential is made available you turn enables in the lawn as soon as you turn the enable signal on what happens this works as a latch this small differential gets Amplified and you are able to so the small differential between the two is Amplified and you are able to take one of the nodes to zero and the other back to one okay and what is important is that when you turn this on you see that these pmoses will automatically turn off so when you do this when you discharge one node to zero and recharge the other node to full vdd you are only talking about this capacitance now not about the entire bit line capacitance so in a way this full swing you have limited only to a small capacitance so sense amplifiers also help to save power so we started to use sense amplifiers to gain speed but it is very important to realize that sense amplifiers are less discharge on bit lines also helps to save power so sense amplifiers are therefore very important circuits to be used and understood when you design memories so in the memory design course there will be a project or two on sense amplifiers also so with that I think so there are other things which you've already done row decoders so decoding we've already take you know when we were doing logical effort and everything I'm not sure you realize but you already took a decoding example only so decoding we have kind of already taken care of and fence amplifiers is the part of IO that we are taken care of so in this session I have kind of introduced you sporadically to the most important components alpha memory any questions sir what is the minimum amount of time for which we need to wait till this bit line is a bit line appears at the sense amplifier input and then we turn on the sensorable signal yeah so just like any other amplifier run it a sense amplifier also has a minimum offset requirement to be able to distinguish zero and one correctly yes sir so that offset is characterized we will do that in the memory design course that offset is characterized and then it is ensured that the offset that appears on the bit lines or the differential that appears on the bit lines is more than that offset okay so there is something called as replica path inside the memory we will talk about it in the MDT course which is used to do this tuning okay but yeah this is characteristic of this of the sense amplifier so if you end up taking a sense a project on sense amplifier like a few of your colleagues have actually taken a project on sense amplifier in in in DVD course also you if you attend the presentations you are all expected to attend the presentation on Friday and Saturday so when you will attend the presentations you will get to see the constraints and the details about it okay okay so I have a basic question sir so am I allowed to run my poly in a horizontal directions actually previously when we were uh talking about this in one of the class I remember that you said we are we will not be using Pauline Horizon but I can't exactly remember what was the reason for that okay what could what can you imagine to be the reason for that so actually I got this dot because we were you in a 60 SRAM layout police were horizontal sir so I can rotate them and now so what is important is there should be in One Direction yes you can rotate the layout it will be all vertical then okay okay sir nice is there exact reasons or was that crosstalk reason not diffraction Optics resolution enhancement techniques do not allow poly to be run in two directions otherwise the mask will not be generated in the right way okay thank you okay so it was lithography yes Akash so one more reason can be this also key if we use a one Pauline vertical and one horizontal then the metal layers that we use to connect them they will be a somewhat vertical metal layers that will waste our area yeah yeah but no that is not the reason the reason essentially is that uh uh Optics doesn't allow that so you'll have to put a contact on poly and then only that contact needs to be tagged by a method is it not yes sir yes sir whether police horizontal or vertical doesn't matter you're only looking at a point on the poly then okay so but the reason essentially is Optics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1jI2eLBQ8g,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1jI2eLBQ8g
Transcript: top level view of it we will discuss all this in much more detail in the course okay we can even remove the subtraction from this course just now now what is very important to look at is the layout so you have spent a lot of time working on the layout of the standard sets where we said that for every structure you would want to keep a distance of half DRC from the pr boundary you remember just now in the morning vaishna was asking so contacts can I remove that half DRC rule thus in the morning question I was asking so over there we're talking about no sharing nothing in fact leaving half the RC from the cell boundary memory I would want to talk about the layout because in memories you say that you would want to share as much around the cell boundary as possible because you have a structured array you know that your memory cell is abutted with another memory cell only not that aoi 221 will be abuted with aoi121 you know it is it is another memory cell because you are aware of this and because there is a structured array you actually start to share devices across the cell boundary so if this blue line is the cell boundary you see I share so can you tell me which are the pull downs and which is where is the pull up and where is the pass gate smallest one in the center is the pull up yeah the one in the end well and well would mean that we're talking about CMOS over there so that is the pull up so these two are the Pull-Ups and this connection would then be the connection to vdd then this one the smaller so it means one of these is basket the other one is pull you down from the s m constraint we realized that for cell stability pass gate has to be more resistive than the pull down so the top one is pass gate and over here the bottom one is pass gate and the other devices pull down so this connection would be for the bit line this would be for the bit line bar and then this connection will be for ground and then this would be wordline connections only in memories you use this kind of a long contact you made layouts if you make a rectangular contact what do you see DRC comes so vaishna was talking about contact to contact spacing and how it is impacting the area so in a memory because density is is of importance what we do is instead of putting two contacts one contact separately on the poly and one contact separately on the active and then maintaining a DRC between them we actually kind of merge two contacts and form a long contact and this long contact is allowed to be used only inside a memory why can you do this only inside a memory and not elsewhere any ideas friends uh sir because we are going to drop some drop some vrs very very uh we know we know where where all the points are where we are going to drop the VR so some drcs can be adjusted see we know that this is the only configuration in which you are allowing these long contacts so you can play with the Optics why are these drcs there when we were discussing early on in the course we were talking about drcs and how how we have this 193 nanometer light which is still used to make features which are 28 nanometers wide and and all that is it not so we said that okay because of this large wavelength of light uh putting stuff on mask is very complex so you can't do it therefore the RCs constraining the RCU that poly has to be in One Direction only and this and that and what not now it means that all those rules are largely because of Optics and if the in Optics you can predefine patterns okay then you can make the diffraction plate in such a way that you can still make structures well so by playing with what is called as resolution enhancement techniques we allow large contacts long contacts only inside the SRAM cell because we know that this is going to be available in this array only and nowhere else and in this array also there is a pattern a fixed pattern in which they will be there so I have a clear diffraction pattern for which I have to optimize my mask making process and therefore it is only allowed in the memory cell and nowhere else okay you show the contacts that are closed and violating DRC they should be made in different masks right they should be made in different different masks means if they are made in same mask so uh means if the minimum loss is nowhere nowhere outside the memory you are allowed to wallet any DRC they believe yesterday okay so you not even think about how to do it only inside the memory DRC violations are allowed for the purpose of gaining more density and this is approved or this is designed by the technology team not by you you can only request they will say if they will do it or not if it is possible on Silicon or not can you see okay so you don't even think of violating the RCs not allowed okay shubham so these long contacts you will see only inside the memory cell okay and then you have these metal layers you will see these small small stubs for connecting these contacts to bit lines vdd the word line stubs and the ground so you will notice that now when you made this stuff for ground there is a particular VR which is shared across four memory cells see this contact this VR they were shared across to my research Cooper needs it but this these vrs and contacts which are coming on the corners are shared across four memory cells so violent standard cells you would not allow any sharing in fact if you were to follow standard cell rules you will have to have memory cell which is this big but by allowing the sharing you've reduced the memory area to this much okay and then this is the word lines the word lines are running and you have these stubs for ground so an array then appears to look like this so this is a two cross two array there and that is how you ensure that srams are much much denser than latches and flip flops and other shift resistors that we were talking about in the earlier in the day okay any questions here Okay so with this layout part also done we need to talk about sense amplifiers so whenever you talk about memories you know people talk about bit cells they talk about bit cell stability they talk about bit cell layout those who know memories they will also talk about the layout and then they will talk about the sense amplifier so I'm just giving you a quick one or two slide glimpse of a sense amplifier we said there is a memory array wordline would come it would select a bit cell and that bit cell will discharge a bit line and then I will get to see the output somewhere down there now this bit nine has a huge capacitance on it if I want to discharge this particular bit line there is some you know I had what we said we had to charge this capacitance to vdd I want to discharge it to at least really by 2 to say that I have a zero so what kind of charge are we talking about t v d d by two kind of charge you're talking about and depending on the cell current there is a time huh there is a time it will take to discharge the particular bit line in this particular example that is given you don't need to even go into details you're talking about 7.5 nanoseconds we want to operate your memories are at least one gigahertz you have only one nanosecond available with you so what to do so you say oh I don't want to discharge full vdd to get to less than one nanosecond I can discharge only to vdd by 8 let us say or still lower VD by 10 will divide 12. it's the Lesser I discharge the faster I can be so what do you do you say o so let us put an amplifier down there which would amplify a vdd by 12 discharge into a full VD discharge at the output um that is why a sense amplifier is the motivation for using a sense amplifier clear any questions around that so I'm telling you'll write a story you can read the book and they will tell you a lot of other details I'm just telling it to you like a story so that you can get the intuitive feel of it you will do all the other details when we do the course but since we are touching memories in the DVD course you should know at least these few four three four things five things about memories foreign so we need sense amplifiers to get the speed a sense amplifier is typically a latch again and if you notice this appears to be the same structure as a memory cell except that there is an enable gate there okay so what happens is what happens is you discharge the bit line and that discharge starts to appear on the internal nodes of the sense amplifier when you have the sufficient discharge for this latch to operate you turn this enable signal on so till that time this was not a latch because the enable was off there was no ground Supply coming there but when the sufficient differential is made available you turn enables in the lawn as soon as you turn the enable signal on what happens this works as a latch this small differential gets Amplified and you are able to so the small differential between the two is Amplified and you are able to take one of the nodes to zero and the other back to one okay and what is important is that when you turn this on you see that these pmoses will automatically turn off so when you do this when you discharge one node to zero and recharge the other node to full vdd you are only talking about this capacitance now not about the entire bit line capacitance so in a way this full swing you have limited only to a small capacitance so sense amplifiers also help to save power so we started to use sense amplifiers to gain speed but it is very important to realize that sense amplifiers are less discharge on bit lines also helps to save power so sense amplifiers are therefore very important circuits to be used and understood when you design memories so in the memory design course there will be a project or two on sense amplifiers also so with that I think so there are other things which you've already done row decoders so decoding we've already take you know when we were doing logical effort and everything I'm not sure you realize but you already took a decoding example only so decoding we have kind of already taken care of and fence amplifiers is the part of IO that we are taken care of so in this session I have kind of introduced you sporadically to the most important components alpha memory any questions sir what is the minimum amount of time for which we need to wait till this bit line is a bit line appears at the sense amplifier input and then we turn on the sensorable signal yeah so just like any other amplifier run it a sense amplifier also has a minimum offset requirement to be able to distinguish zero and one correctly yes sir so that offset is characterized we will do that in the memory design course that offset is characterized and then it is ensured that the offset that appears on the bit lines or the differential that appears on the bit lines is more than that offset okay so there is something called as replica path inside the memory we will talk about it in the MDT course which is used to do this tuning okay but yeah this is characteristic of this of the sense amplifier so if you end up taking a sense a project on sense amplifier like a few of your colleagues have actually taken a project on sense amplifier in in in DVD course also you if you attend the presentations you are all expected to attend the presentation on Friday and Saturday so when you will attend the presentations you will get to see the constraints and the details about it okay okay so I have a basic question sir so am I allowed to run my poly in a horizontal directions

Transcript: there is a murder somewhere or something like that what happens a detective is brought in a detective would look at the artifacts the evidence on the ground and then say oh this is the murderer so that is what we have to do we will only be given the artifacts okay the system has failed so murder has happened someone has killed the circuit and you need to identify who was the killer what was the reason why because of which the circuit failed make sense that's why it's called a detective review review because it's we're talking about the closure of our course and and what all we discussed will kind of cover it up today so let us look at the first circuit failure you designed it two inch to one multiplexer do you see this is a two is to one multiplexer now when you designed it you saw that mux works when d is 0 but not when it is 1 or it starts to say that low v ready or it starts to sail at sfsf corner so what could be the reason of this failure so one could be high vt of the device one could be high vt of the device okay if the devices are high vt then uh those n mosses become slow okay slow slow corner fail so you say so it is high vt okay i get it but high vt say yeah what is the failure mode why is there a failure so the threshold is uh too high and that is why the threshold drop is too high and the inverter input is not getting enough high input so that y goes to zero so what we are saying is that because it's a past transistor logic see zero it says is able to work but one is not working so it means that past transistor logic here it is nmos based one is not working means vt drop is the the culprit and what further strengthens our belief in that it says it fails at low vdd so if it if it is low vdd then vdd minus vt is still lower and that x may not really go up it means x may not be able to uh turn on the nmos and turn off the pmos so that y would change huh so low vdd this kind of fits in sf at the slow corners ah okay slow corners vt is higher oh the failure is more more evident on slow corners so it kind of all the three symptoms kind of feed into each other and we can say that the principle is threshold drop because of which x never rises above vdd minus vt and due to which the output doesn't toggle so what is the solution how would you solve this vdd should be increased and and also the processes so only they could be that we we have to improve the process for vt you are a circuit designer so i want a designer solution we can replace the transmission if you could replace the n masses pass transistor logic by transmission gates so also if restorers are introduced with ptlr yeah but restoratively you need you restorer will be using the output why is it not if the device was coming fine it would have been anyways okay there was no problem in the first place then do you see that yes a better solution is use transmission gates because the problem is because of vt drop so could skewing the output inverter also work good but why limited way may some other some a little lower variety it will fail yes i know transmission gate is robust now it will not fail skewing the inverter using keeper they will only push the boundary of failure a bit transmission gate will solve the problem are you able to see this yes sir"

Transcript: huh you load zero on to q then you take phi to zero however after some time q flips to one what is happening say x is floating so leakage would be there excess floating so leakage would be there leakage from where to where sub threshold leakage why are the transmission gauge like so leakage would be there from from x node to the output of this first inverter input inverter so in this particular latch you have taken already taken care of quite a few problems but all have you taken care of you've taken care of diffusion input problems you have taken care of output noise immunity and so on however because x is floating what happens x is susceptible to get changed if it's a very long time then x could leak into the input buffer or it could also happen that if for example x is a capacitance and there is a coupling capacitance linked to x a transition happens on that others node y and x would also see some extra charge come in or some some noise injected and that can lead to a output flip because x is a floating node so what is the solution how do you solve this you keep a feedback but so that it doesn't uh always give q bar to x so keep a feedback keeper yes so you have to give a full feedback through a tri state so that you are able to write into the cell into the latch also properly and you also are able to maintain the level of x the way you wanted it is that okay uh sir but this leakage that is happening here is a very and very uh uh it is not very it won't be very common the two there are two and most i mean there is a transmission gate and then there is two two things coming in uh so once it will still happen now instead of one nanosecond you will possibly discharge x over 100 900 nanoseconds or one microsecond after some time yeah see it's a latch latch is supposed to store the information till eternity all the time till the power is on the x note should not toggle can you ensure that even a very small leakage will cause a problem yes hello could we say that the first inverter i mean like one one of the points i thought was that probably the first inverter has a low noise margin so for so any disturbance in d is deflected in x and that shifts the q no but there is a transmission gate which is at b will even if it reflects at the output of the inverter doesn't matter the latch is off the rack is opaque okay got that sir yes so can you do one more thing that uh since it is a transition gate and there won't be a wiki draw across the output so we can make the transmission gate itself more resistive by increasing the length of the devices so circuit will become slower but leakage might reduce right leakage would reduce but see it's again there was it we we said okay instead of one nanosecond it will go to 100 nanoseconds now you make the transmission gate resistive it will go to one microsecond one millisecond but the problem will still remain now yes what will it do about crosstalk x is a floating node crosstalk comes what will you do with that so we won't be able to handle that anna so when you offer a solution when you offer a solution as a designer okay you will always have two options today extend the operating range or or you actually solve the problem altogether so when i will ask you questions in the end some exam i'm asking for the solution to the problem not just you know just get a little more juice out of it no that's not what i'm looking for as a circuit designer now you through the dvd course i've introduced it to so many things you know so many so much stuff now you should be able to propose a solution sir i just want to confirm that when we say that x is floating that is fine when we talk about the that i mean that clock feed through or that those kind of thing here then sir we have studied in the analog that when you use a transmission gate then the charges that are emitted by the channel into the floating nodes that is kind of consumed by the other device the nmos will be and most charge will be consumed by a pmos and hence you have uh if not completely no sharing but complete it is it is kind of cancelling out on each other so yeah that that is that is okay so what is the question so sir if we are uh if you are asking that what is the problem then uh this dynamic node uh that leakage would be a major problem rather than the clock field so yeah that is why we said leakage only we did not say clock feed through see look at the symptom the symptom did not say when the clock toggled then then q flip otherwise you would have thought of feed through if it would have been around the clock toggle point it would have been clock feed through but we just kept everything stable and then q spontaneously flips read the question carefully huh q flips spontaneously now what right okay that's the that's the thing anything else should we move forward"

level be low at zoom so if it is coming from very far away the signal might die die out die off [Music] sir we might see two different capacitance at b see delay would change i will take longer to get the signal to my d input if it is coming from far away but if i wait for infinite time i will get it there i have not talked about speed at all anywhere have i so this is not a plausible reason they did you were saying something no no sir mistakenly said i thought it is a pt logic so diffusion input now this is a transmission gate logic yes no i i was telling that uh d might see two different capacitance because uh uh depending upon the level of clock but since it is a transmission gate so it won't happen no over here also depending on the level of clock d will see two different capacitances yes sir clock and clock bodies here so yeah yes it will see two different capacitances so as the delay might increase our input might not match with the timing of the clocks as the delay increases our input might not match with the timing of the clock one do whatever so because it is located very far away i have a large ir drop so my d goes down it doesn't even if i get a one it when it reaches deep uh because of the air it is still zero it is not crazy so one thing that we have all been able to identify is that diffusion input is causing the problem the second thing that all of you are also able to sense is that it is coming it is written that it is coming from far away so there is a rc network which is coming into picture before that input driver is able to drive this deep in so basically when i want to write into this latch see q stuck at 1 means i am not able to write a 0. i am not able to write into the latch am i right that is why q got stuck now i wanted to write here i'm not able to write what happens it means x is not being able to either be discharged or charged are you able to see this q is stuck means x is also stuck now that even though the feedback is weak even though the feedback at v is weak it is still fighting any change in the level of x and therefore d has a tough time to write into x so what is happening over here is we are saying it's a ratio failure a size failure because the feedback is weak even though the feedback is weak it is not letting x change because the driver is still weaker driver is so far far away see the strength of a device we have always in the since the beginning of the course we we said that sense of the the strength of the device can be modeled as a resistance of the device logical effort everywhere we said resistance you remember now because the driver is located far far away you've added extra resistance in the discharge path so it means you have made the effective driver much weaker than what it actually is because you've placed it very far away so what do you do you either bring the driver closer fire up the driver or you re reduce the feedback still lesser to still lesser value so this network that that is being shown here this network has to be stronger than even the weak feedback that we are providing there are you able to see this any questions sir we can use uh buffers before the input of d right sir two yes yes so because you as a designer you cannot control what the value of this ra is what is this how weak will you make it if you make it very very weak it will not even function as a feedback is it not it will unnecessarily slow down your entire circuit so the best solution is avoid unbuffered diffusion inputs put a buffer here as soon as you put a buffer here now this is entirely in your control are you able to see this sir uh sir would the circuit become better if we use a tri-state feedback tri-state feedback yes can help in the sense that it will turn it off completely when you are writing it will do that but it will still be much slower see anyway for tri-state you are saying that you will add two devices one nmos and one pmos yes sir if you have to add two devices i would prefer putting those two here yes sir it will help yes okay if you can add two more devices i would say make it tri-state yes okay because uncon so this this this latch without a tri-state over here is called as uncontrolled latch sir putting a tri-state without having an input buffer i don't think that's a better solution right sorry no no so that is why input input buffer is the first thing then if you can give more area put a tri-state you do not use uncontrolled latches why because then even after this this inverter buffer being put here there is still a fight condition between this this inverter and this inverter so in the presence of process variations which would anyways happen at advanced technology notes at minor geometries in the presence of process variations you may not be able to right into this latch again it must appear as stuck okay sir one thing uh even if we put a tri-state buffer there the node before the inverter at that node the capacitance in it would be still equals to if it is there if there was an inverter because still it would be connected to one end motion but so so wait look at it like this for for the if the if i put an inverter at this deep end to buffer the buffer the input huh do you realize that however small the signal is because there is no fight back you will still be able to charge d it may take 100 nanoseconds no problems but i will still be able to charge sufficient drive strength is here yes because there is no fight back there is nothing killing that drive strength even if this driver is small you will still be able to charge it okay it may take longer now once this d has charged the inverter will buffer and it will overpower the weak feedback and it will write into this cell you see now you see should we move forward is this see this this aspect this is from where i look at it one of the most important aspects of this course where whatever we have learned till now we are now bringing it all together and applying that knowledge to debug that is why debug as i mentioned is the highest level of skill even higher than creativity sir can we use a comparator here before states can we use a comparator so if there is if i want to pass vd high voltage one if it even reduces because of the large network large if the signal is coming from large path so that i will uh pass it to a comparator c i compare with vdd by two then i will push it to one or zero depending on the verb comparing you can't do that but is that a better solution than simply buffering the input but buffering this area what will take lesser power a buffer would take but uh buffer input is still weak right so yeah but it is you can size the buffer input stronger than this weak feedback no that is all that you need yeah see the situation is in control why do we need to go into a circuit which would be much bigger the comparator is not a small circuit it's a huge success yes and then it would have huge current consumption also a lot lot of power also lot of leakage also so areas area power everything is getting degraded where a small inverter as the input could have done the job okay you know when there is a small solution yeah i use a bigger one when a needle can work why do you know in fact at places where the needle will work the sword will not do anything can't do anything so we if the needle is sufficient we use the needle only okay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjMW6AZYgAE,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjMW6AZYgAE

PLAHCLYSq3g_gz5ZyNlrCnnWgWWxQLeZZR,kYySz-pWoRc,this is no longer a quiz now detective review has has happened now we need to just understand that how other what are the other reasons because of its circuit conference and as circuit designers we should avoid that um so there can be so many sources of noise power supply noise ground bounds capacitive coupling chart sharing leakage noise feed through and the consequences are increase delay because you want the noise to settle down and then you will be able to latch the data or incorrect computations just just like we saw in the previous examples those if the latch gets corrupted because of bad day driving or because of that diffusion input and there being a minus 500 variables on the input so whatever then you compute out of that will also go wrong are you able to see this so uh this noise is something that you should always be very careful about whenever you are designing circuits any kind of noise should not lead to corruption in your output now another important thing that I would want you to at least know about when when we uh stock of failures and failure modes is the concept of reliability what is reliability liability means that for how long will your chip function you see there's a warranty of five years two years one year 10 years how much warranty do you want on a chip that goes in your car 15 years 15 years so it means we're talking about a useful operating life period of 15 years what we are essentially saying is so what is observed is that if suppose 100 or 1000 or 10 000 chips are manufactured now this is not just about tips this is about cars this is about anything So within the first let us say few tests it says many of them will fail so the failure rate will be high in the Fab itself in the testing facility it says many will die a few will die after getting into the customer hands but then the failure rate will remain low for a very long time but after that the failure rate will start to climb again Hmm this curve represents the shape of a bathtub therefore this is called as bathtub curve where this is called infant mortality and this rise is called as wear out and this is a useful lifetime you would want to increase the useful Lifetime by as much as possible so you want to test when you when you design tests for your circuits you would want that you would push this to as foreign and this also as far out as possible so that operating life period increases but why do these failures happen hmm we are saying that there are these failures Happening Here There are failures happening here why are these failures happening so the reason for infant mortality could be that the while making the device it was not made uh according to what what it could it should be and then wear out could happen because the parts of the devices are veering out with time though so that is a natural process yes so there could be we are out of oxide so gate dielectric breakdown can happen interconnect we are out where we say that okay there was this wire that we made but due to so much current flowing through it after some time it became open so there is an open there it kind of broke this could be because of what we call as electromigration I may have a slide after this on that over voltage failure because of over voltage some gets broke down latch up because of its huge current few started to flow and overheating happen and the device broke down soft errors what are soft errors do you know do you know what is very excited particle injection into the drain region or source region of a most sir leading to formation of charge in the diffusion so that's my discharge or charge up a node unconditionally okay so software is called a soft error because as the name suggests it's not permanent um after some time it will go away so what does this mean if the software will go away after some time what are we talking about operating conditions it means there is a transient event that happened as David said there is a there see you remember Nuclear Physics that we studied in 11th and 12th class we talked about decomposition of uranium into thorium and so on you remember those equations half-life of barium and half-life of uranium nuclear reactions everything huh all of us studied that in school yes yes so what did what happens when uranium breaks down it also generates FAFSA particles neutrons beta particles and so on hello now uranium is very radioactive you're not even talking about it yet but in our ambient environment there are all these Alpha Beta gamma particles there and okay not very dense not that the density is very very high but they are still there because some stress radioactivity is there all around us so while they don't bother us you know they may cause a mutation in one or two of our cells in the body the cell will naturally flush it out people say you should fast on a regular basis so that you know Auto Theory happens and any tumerous or any cancerous cells anything that is mutant dies out by its own so all those things we talk about yeah so but for chips what happens in ic is oh you can't fast I see sir you can't make ICS fast so you are storing a zero on some place a high energy particle came that led to a Char generation see finally that high energy particle came and its right the substrate something growing through the substrate at once there is a slurry of electron and hole pairs that are generated due to voltages on the on the die of voltages on the chip those electron voltage electron hole pairs will actually electrons will go to one place towards the positive Supply and holes would go towards the negative Supply so it means there is some current that is flowing when this flow of current happens it can lead to flipping of data corrupting of information however the next time you do the same operation it may not reappear you are adding two numbers next you you got a wrong output you tried adding them again now it is fine so it was a soft error it was a transient error it happened and it will not you will not be able to re-re bring that error into the system that also you need to be careful of so we'll just look at all of these and let's in a just a little more detail but I'm just introducing them to you on this slide and what is also important is that we characterize reliability by talking of it in terms of how many failures I mean if there are million devices how many of them would fail in a thousand dollars that is called as failure and time or if if I have a device which operates for this many hours how many failures would happen so mean time between failures and failure and time fit and mtbf are two terms that you may hear when you re or when you which you hear or read when you're talking about reliability so if in an interview someone asks you a question uh what is a fit then you should not be uh whatever fit okay you say that okay this is what I understand about it I know about it but I have not worked on it or if you do a project on reliability then that's a different thing but you should at least know these terms so now I am saying that the car you know the car the chip that you put in your car should work for 15 years I want to test the operating life of a chip so should I actually take a chip manufacture a chip and wait for 15 years to see what is the operating lifetime do I need to do that can I afford to do that probably so what we do is we do accelerated life testing so what has done is uh for example we apply vdd stress what does this mean we said that my chip will typically operate between 1.08 volts to 1.32 volts I say I will test my chip at 1.6 volts because I am testing it at a high voltage what would happen this operating lifetime will reduce still higher voltage it will further reduce still higher voltage it will further reduce so it is so much so so I can also increase the temperature so during testing so I am doing this only during testing during testing I apply vdd stress I apply temperature stress I can emulate degradation or reliability failures that would happen in 10 years within let us say one week so can you wait for one week before you send out your chip to the customer yes but you cannot wait for 15 years so to emulate different lifetimes for example to emulate 10 years it could be one week emulate two years it could be just one day within one day you have degraded the device by two two years it could be just uh what do you say five hours for uh six months so there are these so what what is done is this kind of analysis is done as to uh what kind of degradation is coming in all you need is the slope the slope of this curve so you you out of say let us say your lot has thousand dice you take out 10 dice 10 working days you take out and you put them in this kind of a x related lifetime testing setup one die or one set of dies you will take out after 10 hours you will measure the failure rate another set of dies you will take out after say 24 hours you will measure what is the failure rate another set you will take out after 48 hours uh it is ending my show okay restart you're going to see my presentation again yes yes yeah so what we do is we we put different kinds of stress and we generate this these lines then we say okay uh at at my target voltage which is 0.9 plus minus 10 percent my system will be 10 years of age will will live for 10 years this lower Curve will just hit it the upper one would actually uh possibly live even 20 years so this is how you do accelerated live testing so I have a question,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYySz-pWoRc,"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYySz-pWoRc
Transcript: this is no longer a quiz now detective review has has happened now we need to just understand that how other what are the other reasons because of its circuit conference and as circuit designers we should avoid that um so there can be so many sources of noise power supply noise ground bounds capacitive coupling chart sharing leakage noise feed through and the consequences are increase delay because you want the noise to settle down and then you will be able to latch the data or incorrect computations just just like we saw in the previous examples those if the latch gets corrupted because of bad day driving or because of that diffusion input and there being a minus 500 variables on the input so whatever then you compute out of that will also go wrong are you able to see this so uh this noise is something that you should always be very careful about whenever you are designing circuits any kind of noise should not lead to corruption in your output now another important thing that I would want you to at least know about when when we uh stock of failures and failure modes is the concept of reliability what is reliability liability means that for how long will your chip function you see there's a warranty of five years two years one year 10 years how much warranty do you want on a chip that goes in your car 15 years 15 years so it means we're talking about a useful operating life period of 15 years what we are essentially saying is so what is observed is that if suppose 100 or 1000 or 10 000 chips are manufactured now this is not just about tips this is about cars this is about anything So within the first let us say few tests it says many of them will fail so the failure rate will be high in the Fab itself in the testing facility it says many will die a few will die after getting into the customer hands but then the failure rate will remain low for a very long time but after that the failure rate will start to climb again Hmm this curve represents the shape of a bathtub therefore this is called as bathtub curve where this is called infant mortality and this rise is called as wear out and this is a useful lifetime you would want to increase the useful Lifetime by as much as possible so you want to test when you when you design tests for your circuits you would want that you would push this to as foreign and this also as far out as possible so that operating life period increases but why do these failures happen hmm we are saying that there are these failures Happening Here There are failures happening here why are these failures happening so the reason for infant mortality could be that the while making the device it was not made uh according to what what it could it should be and then wear out could happen because the parts of the devices are veering out with time though so that is a natural process yes so there could be we are out of oxide so gate dielectric breakdown can happen interconnect we are out where we say that okay there was this wire that we made but due to so much current flowing through it after some time it became open so there is an open there it kind of broke this could be because of what we call as electromigration I may have a slide after this on that over voltage failure because of over voltage some gets broke down latch up because of its huge current few started to flow and overheating happen and the device broke down soft errors what are soft errors do you know do you know what is very excited particle injection into the drain region or source region of a most sir leading to formation of charge in the diffusion so that's my discharge or charge up a node unconditionally okay so software is called a soft error because as the name suggests it's not permanent um after some time it will go away so what does this mean if the software will go away after some time what are we talking about operating conditions it means there is a transient event that happened as David said there is a there see you remember Nuclear Physics that we studied in 11th and 12th class we talked about decomposition of uranium into thorium and so on you remember those equations half-life of barium and half-life of uranium nuclear reactions everything huh all of us studied that in school yes yes so what did what happens when uranium breaks down it also generates FAFSA particles neutrons beta particles and so on hello now uranium is very radioactive you're not even talking about it yet but in our ambient environment there are all these Alpha Beta gamma particles there and okay not very dense not that the density is very very high but they are still there because some stress radioactivity is there all around us so while they don't bother us you know they may cause a mutation in one or two of our cells in the body the cell will naturally flush it out people say you should fast on a regular basis so that you know Auto Theory happens and any tumerous or any cancerous cells anything that is mutant dies out by its own so all those things we talk about yeah so but for chips what happens in ic is oh you can't fast I see sir you can't make ICS fast so you are storing a zero on some place a high energy particle came that led to a Char generation see finally that high energy particle came and its right the substrate something growing through the substrate at once there is a slurry of electron and hole pairs that are generated due to voltages on the on the die of voltages on the chip those electron voltage electron hole pairs will actually electrons will go to one place towards the positive Supply and holes would go towards the negative Supply so it means there is some current that is flowing when this flow of current happens it can lead to flipping of data corrupting of information however the next time you do the same operation it may not reappear you are adding two numbers next you you got a wrong output you tried adding them again now it is fine so it was a soft error it was a transient error it happened and it will not you will not be able to re-re bring that error into the system that also you need to be careful of so we'll just look at all of these and let's in a just a little more detail but I'm just introducing them to you on this slide and what is also important is that we characterize reliability by talking of it in terms of how many failures I mean if there are million devices how many of them would fail in a thousand dollars that is called as failure and time or if if I have a device which operates for this many hours how many failures would happen so mean time between failures and failure and time fit and mtbf are two terms that you may hear when you re or when you which you hear or read when you're talking about reliability so if in an interview someone asks you a question uh what is a fit then you should not be uh whatever fit okay you say that okay this is what I understand about it I know about it but I have not worked on it or if you do a project on reliability then that's a different thing but you should at least know these terms so now I am saying that the car you know the car the chip that you put in your car should work for 15 years I want to test the operating life of a chip so should I actually take a chip manufacture a chip and wait for 15 years to see what is the operating lifetime do I need to do that can I afford to do that probably so what we do is we do accelerated life testing so what has done is uh for example we apply vdd stress what does this mean we said that my chip will typically operate between 1.08 volts to 1.32 volts I say I will test my chip at 1.6 volts because I am testing it at a high voltage what would happen this operating lifetime will reduce still higher voltage it will further reduce still higher voltage it will further reduce so it is so much so so I can also increase the temperature so during testing so I am doing this only during testing during testing I apply vdd stress I apply temperature stress I can emulate degradation or reliability failures that would happen in 10 years within let us say one week so can you wait for one week before you send out your chip to the customer yes but you cannot wait for 15 years so to emulate different lifetimes for example to emulate 10 years it could be one week emulate two years it could be just one day within one day you have degraded the device by two two years it could be just uh what do you say five hours for uh six months so there are these so what what is done is this kind of analysis is done as to uh what kind of degradation is coming in all you need is the slope the slope of this curve so you you out of say let us say your lot has thousand dice you take out 10 dice 10 working days you take out and you put them in this kind of a x related lifetime testing setup one die or one set of dies you will take out after 10 hours you will measure the failure rate another set of dies you will take out after say 24 hours you will measure what is the failure rate another set you will take out after 48 hours uh it is ending my show okay restart you're going to see my presentation again yes yes yeah so what we do is we we put different kinds of stress and we generate this these lines then we say okay uh at at my target voltage which is 0.9 plus minus 10 percent my system will be 10 years of age will will live for 10 years this lower Curve will just hit it the upper one would actually uh possibly live even 20 years so this is how you do accelerated live testing so I have a question"
